The writer, a public officer then working at the Pioneer Generation Office, had a chance encounter with an unhappy shopkeeper who thought the Government had ended her husband’s Eldershield coverage after he turned 65. He had been paying premiums all these years, not making any claims, and how could the Government be so cruel now to take it away! 

The officer could not believe this. She did a quick Google check on her phone, and reassured the shopkeeper that she was mistaken – while her husband had indeed stopped paying premiums, he was in fact covered by Eldershield for the rest of his life! She explained that the scheme was so designed that he only had to pay premiums while he was working, and not after he retired. The officer’s personal explanation made the difference in communicating a good policy, and the shopkeeper went home eager to share the good news.  

The Government makes and updates policies all the time. We must do better at explaining them, letting people know how they are affected, and how they can benefit. The Pioneer Generation Ambassadors have done an excellent job explaining the PG Package. We need to do the same with other policies too, especially those that concern everyone, like #SGSecure and CPF Life.

As PM, Mr Key and his team dealt with some major challenges, including the global financial crisis and the 2011 Christchurch earthquake. His leadership helped transform New Zealand into a resilient and vibrant economy, and he has now given his successor the best chance of taking over and building on his achievements.

We have worked closely on defence, economic cooperation, and regional issues. Mr Key was a strong advocate of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP). Singapore and New Zealand are two of the four countries which formed the P4, the small FTA that led to the much more ambitious TPP.

In his eight years as PM, John and I became good friends. He had lived and worked in Singapore before, and has a soft spot for chilli crabs. We saw eye-to-eye on many issues, and got on very well. I shall miss John at international meetings. I wish him and his family all the best for the future. – LHL

Shared my thoughts at the PAP Party Conference this morning. Major changes are taking place in the world. They impact not just individual countries, but also the wider international order that Singapore depends on. Developed countries are turning inward, and becoming more nativist and protectionist. This trend will have serious consequences for small, open countries like Singapore.

In this difficult environment, we must continue to improve the lives of Singaporeans. We must equip Singaporeans with the skills to take care of themselves, help workers re-skill and upgrade through SkillsFuture, and strengthen social safety nets to provide more support for our aging population.

We are entering a period of great uncertainty. For Singapore to remain prosperous, strong and united, our policies must bring all Singaporeans closer together. 

We can overcome our challenges and take Singapore forward if we continue to work together as one.

Saya gembira melihat sekolah-sekolah bergiat aktif dalam menyediakan persekitaran bahasa Melayu kepada anak-anak kita. Guru-guru juga memainkan peranan penting untuk mengajar dan mendorong para pelajar kita selesa dan seronok menggunakan bahasa ibunda.

创建于1898年，莲山双林寺是新加坡最古老的佛教寺庙。双林寺有多过一百年的历史， 是我们第一座被列为国家古迹的佛教寺庙。今天，过了二十年的幸苦，双林寺的法堂已经落成，法堂是双林寺第二期修建计划的主体建筑。我在致词时（http://bit.ly/2fHBotD）， 恭喜所有参与双林寺修复工程的人士，功德圆满。:)

佛教信徒是新加坡最大的宗教团体。佛教徒重视无私，同情和宽容等价值观，对我们的种族和宗教和谐作出了重要贡献，希望大家继续努力，一同打造一个更美好和谐的新加坡。– 李显龙",90,277,5407,0,1,168,1,28

Being in Singapore, Google named the areas around their campus ‘kampungs’, to encourage the kampung (village) spirit of good neighbours and collaboration.

Having the campus here is a step in our #SmartNation journey. Tech is disruptive, and we expect to be disrupted. But with partners like Google, Singapore will come up on the right side of the disruption.

The Association of Muslim Professionals (AMP Singapore) has played a valuable role in the Malay/Muslim community since their formation in 1991. Aside from their education, youth and social assistance programmes, AMP has also invested in innovative projects such as Common Space – an incubator to groom start ups from the community.

I was happy to attend AMP’s 25th anniversary dinner last night. I hope AMP carries on working closely with MENDAKI Singapore and other Malay/Muslim organisations, so that the community can continue to shine in our multi-racial Singapore. – LHL

Sejak pembentukannya pada 1991, AMP telah memainkan peranan penting dalam membantu masyarakat Melayu/Islam bergerak maju bersama kaum-kaum lain di Singapura. Selain daripada program pendidikan dan bantuan sosial, AMP juga melabur dalam projek inovatif seperti project ""Common Space” – inkubator untuk melahirkan lebih banyak firma teknolgi atau start-up dari masyarakat Melayu/Islam.

87,2016-11-09 16:01:22,"Congratulations to President-Elect Donald Trump! His candidacy took many by surprise. At each stage he defied expectations, and his journey has ultimately taken him to the White House.

It has been a contentious, ugly election season, that has exposed a bitter divide in the American people. Many will celebrate this result, while others will understandably be surprised and disappointed. But like the Brexit referendum in June, Mr Trump’s victory is part of a broader pattern in developed countries – reflecting a deep frustration with the way things are, and a strong wish to reassert a sense of identity, and somehow to change the status quo. 

US voters have elected a President whom they feel best represents them. Singapore fully respects their decision. We will continue to work together with the United States to cultivate our strong ties. – LHL",974,4829,29341,268,269,393,2008,814
88,2016-11-08 21:54:45,"In Parliament today, I explained why the Elected Presidency must be multi-racial. The President is the most important unifying symbol of our multi-racial nation. He must represent all Singaporeans, and every citizen must be able to identify with him.

In January, I appointed a Constitutional Commission to do a review of the scheme.  I’m glad many people came forward to give their views. 

We are adopting the Commission’s proposal to ensure that every ethnic community gets a chance to be President. We call it the “hiatus-triggered” model, which means:

i. Presidential elections will be open to candidates of all races. But if we have not had a President from a particular community for five consecutive terms, the next term will be reserved for a President from that community. 

ii. The candidate in a reserved election must meet the same qualifying criteria, and will be as qualified as any other candidate who stands and wins in a non-reserved election. 

This rule will ensure that our Presidents come from different races, as we work towards our ideal of “one united people, regardless of race, language or religion”.

This year, Team Singapore's Paralympic contingent gave us our best-ever result, with 2 golds and 1 bronze medal at the Rio 2016 Paralympic Games. We invited them to lunch at Parliament today, to catch up with them and officially recognise their achievements with a Parliamentary motion. 

The Paralympians’ success means more than medals. It also reflects the growing acceptance of persons with disabilities in Singapore. To be a champion takes mental fortitude as much as physical capability. Thank you, and congratulations once again! – LHL

President Dr Tony Tan presented the awards to almost 500 exceptional individuals in recognition of their contributions to Singapore. Most were public officers or community leaders, but there were also recipients from other fields – arts, sports, and academia. A few were non-Singaporeans who had served us well, such as our Honorary Consuls General in foreign cities.

I hope you will continue to give of your best to Singapore. We depend on your efforts to keep our little red dot shining bright.

The accompanying text is clever too. Here is a poetic English translation (which alas misses the hidden, untranslatable pun at the end): 

“I am a creature of the night
I crave not for the light
I live out of human sight
But I see their minds' blight

I am not as cute as the otters
Nor a celebrity like the cow
Thus I am undisturbed
And slip through the jaws of death

Unwelcome I may be...a blessing in disguise?”

It was the annual reunion of Lee clan associations from around the world (this time hosted in Singapore). There were 2,000 Lees in the room, including 1,000 from overseas. Not so many, considering there are 130 million Lees in the world! :)

The Singapore Lee Clan General Association also marked its 110th year, and celebrated the renovation of its headquarters in Jalan Besar.

Like other clan groups, the Lee Clan Association has played a part in building Singapore. It does social work, and supports culture and education. When I graduated from school in 1970, the Association gave me a clan scholarship, which I remember fondly.

昨晚李氏盛宴是三禧同庆。

新加坡李氏总会在狮城承办了2016年全球李氏恳亲大会，同时总会也庆祝成立110周年，以及总会大厦翻新工程竣工，可喜可贺。

在110年前成立的李氏总会，这一个多世纪以来对我国作出了许多贡献。它在新加坡的建国过程中，扮演了一定角色。多年来，李氏总会把对宗亲的关爱延伸到社区，跟基层组织联办各种关怀活动，让各族人民受惠。

我也是受益人其中之一，我在1970年高中毕业后，总会办发了一份奖学金给我，至今我记忆犹新。– 李显龙

I did a dialogue with leaders from the unions and labour movement yesterday. I told them this is unlike the Global Financial Crisis in 2008. Today growth is positive, EDB is attracting substantial investments, and we are creating many new jobs. The current slowdown is not an infection that can be cured with one course of antibiotics. What we need instead is a sustained longer-term strategy to build ourselves up, and go for growth.

We are working with businesses to transform industries, upgrade SMEs, and help companies expand overseas. For workers, we are investing in skills training programmes and job matching schemes.

Many countries face similar economic problems. If any country can succeed, Singapore can. We have the tripartite partnership, and will work as one nation together!
