They, and many others like them, sacrifice public holidays, weekends, and especially family time to keep Singapore humming smoothly every single day. As we go out visiting over the festive period, let’s not forget their ‘power’-ful efforts! Thank you for keeping Singapore going! – LHL",66,110,3423,0,5,90,0,25

4,"For everyone celebrating #ChineseNewYear, I hope you are all prepared! Tonight, Chinese families will be gathering for their reunion dinner. If you can’t make it tonight because of work or other reasons, I hope you have arranged to celebrate it earlier, or hold it on another night. The reunion dinner is an ancient tradition, reminding us of what is truly important in life as we enter into the New Year – family, loved ones and friends. 

The lunar new year is also a time to reflect on what others have done for us and how we can pay it forward for our future generations. Find out more from my Chinese New Year Message by clicking on the article below.

May you have a joyful reunion dinner and an abundance of happiness, health and wealth in the Rooster Year! – LHL

Thanks for sharing your photo, Shahrie. Glad to see your family enjoying the Gardens. It’s certainly a beautiful place to visit. Why not pay a visit during the upcoming long weekend? – LHL

7,"It’s Chinese New Year this weekend. For many of us, that means indulging in our favourite treats! The festivities wouldn’t be the same without bak kwa, yusheng, and (especially) pineapple tarts! Alas, the reason they taste so good is the same reason why too much would be bad for us – they’re laden with sugar. 

Here’s one way to combat sugar, but we don’t have to be a kungfu master. Just be aware of what we eat and exercise moderation.

It looks like the rooster is spreading its wings to protect the hen and the tiny chick half hidden in the grass! A timely reminder of the importance of family, even as we busy ourselves with shopping and chores during this festive season.

It was cloudy, but the weather held and our activities were not rained out. Early CNY celebrations had already started so festive cheer was in the air!

Many thanks to MP Cheryl Chan for showing me around. Cheryl and her team are doing a good job. I hope residents will work with them to make Fengshan the best home for all! – LHL",67,232,5314,0,16,145,0,6

Started out yesterday morning by handing out hongbaos to needy residents, and visiting my two wet markets, where old and young were shopping for the New Year.

13,"Fielded a wide range of questions at the Pioneering the Future Series forum jointly presented by the EDB Society and The Straits Times last night.

As expected at a gathering of current and former EDB officers, I was asked about the economy and business, particularly the uncertain global outlook and protectionist sentiments. Other attendees raised relations with China and the US, and of course, politics and succession. My thanks to Han Fook Kwang, ST Editor-at-Large, for ably moderating an interesting discussion!

The beach and mudflats along the shore contrast with the Labrador Park Jetty beyond, and the distinctive silhouette of cranes at PSA Singapore's Pasir Panjang wharves in the distance. 

Besides the rich biodiversity, the reserve also contains historic landmarks such as the Berlayer Beacon and Fort Pasir Panjang – both important connections to our maritime and colonial past. 

Whether you are a nature or history lover, the Reserve has something for you. Why not pay a visit this weekend, and treat yourself to some greenery and fresh air. :) – LHL

Glad to launch the Visit ASEAN@50 campaign at the ASEAN Tourism Forum last night. This year is ASEAN’s 50th anniversary, a significant milestone.

Visit ASEAN@50 will promote ASEAN as one tourist destination. In these uncertain times, countries need closer regional cooperation, to create opportunities and benefits for all of us.

This was my first meeting with PM English since he took over from John Key. He had just visited several European countries, so we talked about developments in Europe, and around the world.

Singapore and New Zealand are old friends. I am confident that our strong ties will deepen further under PM English’s leadership. Looking forward to doing more with New Zealand. – LHL

Pongal is a Tamil harvest festival held to mark the start of the auspicious month of Thai. It is also the name of the rice dish prepared for the festival. Made with milk and jaggery, the milk is allowed to boil over to symbolise overflowing fortune. I learnt how to make this last year – it’s not difficult! :) (bit.ly/2jHT3WO) 

Pongal is one of the many beautiful festivals enjoyed in multiracial Singapore. Little India is holding events to celebrate it. Why not head over to take in the sparkling lights and have a go at cooking Pongal yourself? (http://www.littleindia.com.sg/events-calendar)
