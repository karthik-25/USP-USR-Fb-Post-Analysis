The writer, a public officer then working at the Pioneer Generation Office, had a chance encounter with an unhappy shopkeeper who thought the Government had ended her husband’s Eldershield coverage after he turned 65. He had been paying premiums all these years, not making any claims, and how could the Government be so cruel now to take it away! 

The officer could not believe this. She did a quick Google check on her phone, and reassured the shopkeeper that she was mistaken – while her husband had indeed stopped paying premiums, he was in fact covered by Eldershield for the rest of his life! She explained that the scheme was so designed that he only had to pay premiums while he was working, and not after he retired. The officer’s personal explanation made the difference in communicating a good policy, and the shopkeeper went home eager to share the good news.  

The Government makes and updates policies all the time. We must do better at explaining them, letting people know how they are affected, and how they can benefit. The Pioneer Generation Ambassadors have done an excellent job explaining the PG Package. We need to do the same with other policies too, especially those that concern everyone, like #SGSecure and CPF Life.

As PM, Mr Key and his team dealt with some major challenges, including the global financial crisis and the 2011 Christchurch earthquake. His leadership helped transform New Zealand into a resilient and vibrant economy, and he has now given his successor the best chance of taking over and building on his achievements.

We have worked closely on defence, economic cooperation, and regional issues. Mr Key was a strong advocate of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP). Singapore and New Zealand are two of the four countries which formed the P4, the small FTA that led to the much more ambitious TPP.

In his eight years as PM, John and I became good friends. He had lived and worked in Singapore before, and has a soft spot for chilli crabs. We saw eye-to-eye on many issues, and got on very well. I shall miss John at international meetings. I wish him and his family all the best for the future. – LHL

Shared my thoughts at the PAP Party Conference this morning. Major changes are taking place in the world. They impact not just individual countries, but also the wider international order that Singapore depends on. Developed countries are turning inward, and becoming more nativist and protectionist. This trend will have serious consequences for small, open countries like Singapore.

In this difficult environment, we must continue to improve the lives of Singaporeans. We must equip Singaporeans with the skills to take care of themselves, help workers re-skill and upgrade through SkillsFuture, and strengthen social safety nets to provide more support for our aging population.

We are entering a period of great uncertainty. For Singapore to remain prosperous, strong and united, our policies must bring all Singaporeans closer together. 

We can overcome our challenges and take Singapore forward if we continue to work together as one.

Saya gembira melihat sekolah-sekolah bergiat aktif dalam menyediakan persekitaran bahasa Melayu kepada anak-anak kita. Guru-guru juga memainkan peranan penting untuk mengajar dan mendorong para pelajar kita selesa dan seronok menggunakan bahasa ibunda.

创建于1898年，莲山双林寺是新加坡最古老的佛教寺庙。双林寺有多过一百年的历史， 是我们第一座被列为国家古迹的佛教寺庙。今天，过了二十年的幸苦，双林寺的法堂已经落成，法堂是双林寺第二期修建计划的主体建筑。我在致词时（http://bit.ly/2fHBotD）， 恭喜所有参与双林寺修复工程的人士，功德圆满。:)

It has been a contentious, ugly election season, that has exposed a bitter divide in the American people. Many will celebrate this result, while others will understandably be surprised and disappointed. But like the Brexit referendum in June, Mr Trump’s victory is part of a broader pattern in developed countries – reflecting a deep frustration with the way things are, and a strong wish to reassert a sense of identity, and somehow to change the status quo. 

US voters have elected a President whom they feel best represents them. Singapore fully respects their decision. We will continue to work together with the United States to cultivate our strong ties. – LHL",974,4828,29341,268,269,393,2008,814

In January, I appointed a Constitutional Commission to do a review of the scheme.  I’m glad many people came forward to give their views. 

We are adopting the Commission’s proposal to ensure that every ethnic community gets a chance to be President. We call it the “hiatus-triggered” model, which means:

i. Presidential elections will be open to candidates of all races. But if we have not had a President from a particular community for five consecutive terms, the next term will be reserved for a President from that community. 

ii. The candidate in a reserved election must meet the same qualifying criteria, and will be as qualified as any other candidate who stands and wins in a non-reserved election. 

This rule will ensure that our Presidents come from different races, as we work towards our ideal of “one united people, regardless of race, language or religion”.

If you think this beautiful calligraphy is Arabic, then you are half right! It is written in Arwi, a written form of Tamil that uses an expanded Arabic script. The Singapore Kadayanallur Muslim League (SKML) presented it to me last night at its 75th anniversary dinner.

The SKML's roots go back much further than 75 years, in fact, to the 19th century. They comprise Tamil Muslims originally from Kadayanallur, a city in Tamil Nadu close to the southernmost tip of India. Weavers by trade, many left in search of a better life after British textile mills began exporting cheap textiles to India, putting them out of business. 

Some sailed to Malacca and Penang (and set up Kadayanallur associations there as well). Many arrived in Singapore with little more than the clothes on their back. They became labourers at the port, and sold wet ground spices for curries. 

Today, many have become successful professionals. They have made Singapore their home for three generations or more, just as so many others have done. 

The Tamil Muslim community in Singapore is small – about 20,000 – but have woven their own distinctive strand into our multicultural tapestry. The SKML works with organisations like the Singapore Indian Development Association and MENDAKI Singapore to help more Singaporeans. My congratulations to the SKML on your 75th anniversary.

King Bhumibol was the world's longest-serving monarch, much beloved and revered by his people. He dedicated himself wholly to his country and to improving his people’s lives. His wise leadership and enormous prestige held the country together.

I last met King Bhumibol in 2009, during the ASEAN Summit in Hua Hin, Thailand. He was a most gracious host and took a close interest in ASEAN programmes to promote economic growth and development.

On behalf of Singapore, I offer my deepest condolences to the Royal Family and people of Thailand on their sad loss. May King Bhumibol rest in peace. – LHL

Mr Peres was a visionary who served his country tirelessly all his life. I was privileged to meet him several times, and to benefit from his wisdom and friendship. 

I last called on him in April, at the Peres Centre of Peace in Tel Aviv. He received me graciously. Then 92, he was focussed on the young and the future. He told me why he was convinced that science and education were the way to foster greater understanding between peoples. 

Mr Peres was the last of the founding generation of Israeli leaders. As defence minister in 1976, he advocated the brilliant Entebbe hostage rescue operation. He was the only Israeli statesman to have served both as President and Prime Minister. Mr Peres passionately believed in peace between Israel and the Palestinians, and received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1994 for his efforts to promote peace in the Middle East.

Nine MPs, including Speaker Madam Halimah Yacob, shared personal anecdotes and spoke of Mr Nathan’s long and distinguished service in the trade unions, in the civil service, and as President. He had enormous personal integrity, commitment and generosity. An utterly reliable man who lived life fully, and never gave up despite the challenges he faced. 

After the tributes, the House observed a minute of silence as a mark of respect.

This year, 680 of our pilgrims have made the journey to fulfill their hajj. The hajj is the fifth pillar of Islam. Every year, millions of Muslims perform this pilgrimage to the holy lands in Saudi Arabia. Wishing our pilgrims a safe and meaningful journey. 

Muslims also perform the korban (sacrifice) rites today and distribute the meat to the less fortunate and share among families and friends. Unfortunately, some sheep did not survive the flight to Singapore. We are investigating how this happened. 

Nevertheless, the korban rites are carrying on as scheduled. Those who have pledged to do korban are able to do so. My deep appreciation to all who have worked hard to enable korban rites to take place here. – LHL

Selamat Hari Raya Haji kepada semua umat Islam.
Tahun ini, 680 jemaah Singapura mengerjakan ibadah haji. Haji adalah rukun Islam yang ke lima. Setiap tahun, berjuta-juta umat Islam berhimpun di Tanah Suci di Arab Saudi. Saya harap semua jemaah selamat dan dapat menyempurnakan haji mereka dengan baik.

Umat Islam juga melakukan ibadah korban hari ini. Mereka mengedarkan daging korban kepada golongan yang kurang bernasib baik dan juga berkongsinya bersama keluarga dan kawan-kawan. Saya diberitahu malangnya ada beberapa kambing yang tewas dalam perjalanan ke Singapura. Siasatan sedang dijalankan.
Sungguhpun begitu, ibadah korban tetap berlangsung seperti yang dijadualkan. Mereka yang telah menempah untuk melakukan korban boleh melakukannya. Terima kasih kepada semua yang terlibat dan memastikan ibadah korban dapat disempurnakan di Singapura. – LHL

Second, growth and trade. The ASEAN Economic Community is a good start. We need to conclude the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership. This will expand opportunities for all our businesses. 

Third, maintaining ASEAN unity and credibility. The South China Sea issue is a test of this. Understandably, ASEAN countries have different positions, but we must stand together in the common interest to maintain the peace and stability of the region.

­PM Lee: We now have the core team for the next generation in Cabinet. But Minister or not, all of us are mortal. Minister Heng Swee Keat recently gave us a bad scare. I am very glad that he pulled through, and is steadily recovering. Doctors have given him the go-ahead to do office work, with minimum interaction.

I have therefore decided that Swee Keat will resume duties as Minister for Finance. DPM Tharman Shanmugaratnam will stop covering as Acting Minister. Swee Keat will focus on next year’s Budget and CFE, and I will appoint Lawrence Wong as 2nd Minister to help him out with the operational responsibilities duties for MOF.

Building up leadership and preparing for succession is the top priority. Nothing that has happened has changed my timetable, or my resolve to press on with succession. In the next GE, we will reinforce the team again. Soon after the next GE, my successor must be ready to take over from me. 岁月不留人

206,2016-08-21 21:13:46,"The second issue to review is the qualifying criteria to become a candidate for President. The main purpose of the elected President scheme is to give the President the mandate to decide on two major matters: reserves and appointments. 

The President who safeguards reserves and men must have the right experience to decide whether the Government’s budgets and spending proposals are sound and justified. He must also be able to judge character, motivation, integrity, ability of names put up, and to know what advice to seek and accept.

That is why candidates must meet the qualifying criteria before they stand for election as President. Candidates must have held key appointments in the public service like Speaker, Chief Justice, Ministers, Permanent Secretaries, or had experience in the private sector running large and complex companies like Singtel, DBS and Keppel Corp. The Constitution defines these as companies with $100mil paid up capital.

But this $100mil paid up capital criteria is out of date. When we set it 25 years ago, our economy was much smaller, and our reserves too. Now our economy has grown, government spending and reserves have increased.

The benchmark companies which we had in mind when setting the qualifying criteria have also grown much larger. Running a $100mil company is no longer commensurate with the responsibilities of the President, so we have to update the definition.

207,2016-08-21 21:09:10,"First, strengthening the role of the Council of Presidential Advisors (CPA).

When we designed the system, we had in mind not just an elected President, the person elected by voters, but a President advised by a Council of Presidential Advisors. So that when the President makes decisions, he will have the benefit of the collective experience and judgement of the CPA.

We envisaged that over time, as the CPA became more established, we would build it up further. The CPA arrangements have worked well. The changes proposed to the CPA are incremental and straightforward.

208,2016-08-21 21:08:26,"REVIEW OF THE ELECTED PRESIDENCY

PM Lee: We have a good political, parliamentary system inherited from the British. We have adapted it over time to fit our needs, and one major change we made was to make the President an elected office. The President is the Head of State and the symbol of the nation. Therefore instead of being chosen by Parliament, he has to be elected by the people of Singapore.

We have operated this two-key system for 25 years, and made many adjustments to it. But some aspects have not been revised and we need to bring them up to date.

In January I appointed a Constitutional Commission, chaired by the Chief Justice, to review 3 things:
  - To consider how the President can give more weight to the advice of the Council of Presidential Advisors (CPA)
  - To update the criteria for someone to be a candidate to be President
  - To ensure that minorities regularly have a chance to become President

The Commission submitted its report to me last week and made recommendations for improvement in all 3 areas. We are still studying the report and will release it soon.

Tonight, I won’t talk about specific recommendations by the Commission. I want to explain why we are reviewing the Elected Presidency and to tell you why in these 3 areas we should make changes.

209,2016-08-21 21:06:48,"Q3: HOW DO WE ENSURE GOOD POLITICS FOR SINGAPORE?

PM Lee: I have described some of our strategies to ensure that we progress together and to keep our place in the world. But for all these plans to work, Singapore must have good politics. If our political system malfunctions; if we fail to produce good leaders; if we cannot work together, and are divided among ourselves; then all our best laid plans will come to naught.

The Brexit referendum was a vivid reminder of the importance of good politics. The vote for the UK to leave the EU is already affecting the UK economy. But the bigger impact of the referendum was to deepen fault lines in British society. Why did it happen? Voters lost faith in their leaders and the whole political class. Large segments of the population felt that they were not benefitting from the country’s progress.

The same thing can happen here. Can Singapore be different? Yes, provided we have politics that unite the people and uphold our multi-racial society. Our leaders must be attuned to people’s aspirations and respond to their concerns, and our political system must be sound.

#ndrsg",4,42,482,0,2,19,0,2
210,2016-08-21 21:02:25,"One of our big pluses is that our religious and community leaders have taken courageous stands. They condemn the terrorist attacks forthrightly, refute extremist views, and make clear that terrorists do not represent Islam, or Singapore Muslims.

Our Muslim leaders have expressed concerns to us about foreign preachers visiting Singapore who don’t understand our context and want to preach their exclusivist practices and doctrines here. I am glad our leaders are vigilant, making sure that the Islam practised in Singapore suits our multi-racial context.

I also welcome the call by Malay/Muslim community leaders to make the Asatizah Recognition Scheme (ARS) compulsory, to ensure that our religious teachers and scholars are reliable guides for the community. I commend them for taking the initiative to deal with a sensitive problem. These measures will ensure that all asatizah in Singapore understand how Islam is practised there, and can guide their students to live in harmony with fellow Singaporeans of all races and religions.

211,2016-08-21 21:02:18,"TERRORISM
 
One urgent issue where we have to cooperate with our neighbours is terrorism.

Almost every day we read of new attacks somewhere: US, Europe, to Middle East, and closer to home, in Indonesia and Malaysia. Terrorist groups are active all around us in Southeast Asia. In Singapore, the threat is not just from outside but also domestic. We have arrested a dozen Singaporeans who have been radicalised.

Look at other countries. People react in two possible ways after an attack. One, they show a collective will to stand together. The other reaction is distrust and suspicion. The question is: which will happen in Singapore?

Our diplomats and security forces, the Home Team and SAF are doing excellent work. But they alone cannot guarantee our security and safety, or hold us together. All of us must do our part, from understanding our national interest, and supporting Singapore in our relations with other countries, to preparing ourselves to deal with terrorism, and standing together after a terrorist attack.

I will be launching the #SGSecure movement in September. It is a call-to-action to all to be sensitised, trained and mobilised to protect Singapore from a terrorist attack.

Ultimately, what matters most is our resolve to hold together and fight to defend our place in the world.

PM Lee: Malaysia and Indonesia are our two most important partners. We work hard to build our ties, but these are sensitive, complex relationships. There will be differences from time to time, because of their deep-seated attitudes towards us, but today, on the whole, relations with both countries are good.

Last month, I was in Putrajaya to witness the MOU on the High Speed Rail between Singapore and Malaysia. PM Najib hosted us to lunch. The durian was good, but the High Speed Rail will be better!

I meet President Jokowi regularly, including once over nasi lemak, and have been discussing how to enhance our economic cooperation, and encourage more Singapore companies to invest more in Indonesia.

213,2016-08-21 20:44:43,"Sometimes the interests of our friends will conflict, and we will be pressured to choose sides. One current issue which may upset the peace, stability, and friendship of the region is the South China Sea. It is a complicated dispute.

China claims the “nine-dash line”. Four ASEAN countries – Philippines, Brunei, Malaysia, Vietnam – have overlapping claims with China and with one another. The US has no claims but they do have interests at stake.

3 years ago, the Philippines launched a case against China under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). The Tribunal heard the case, and in its Award in July said that China’s claim to historic rights within the “nine-dash line” is incompatible with UNCLOS. China has categorically rejected the Award as “null and void”.

What is Singapore’s interest and stand? We don’t have any claims of our own and we don’t take sides on the specific claims of any of the claimants. But in other ways, we have a lot at stake. Three things matter to us:
  - International law
  - Freedom of Navigation
  - A united ASEAN

Therefore, on this South China Sea issue, we have our own principled and consistent stand. Other countries will persuade us to side with them but we have to choose our own place to stand, and not succumb to pressure.

Singapore has a reputation to protect. We cooperate with other countries, but we make our own calculations. That is what makes us credible and valuable to others, to our ASEAN partners, and powers like the US, China and Europe. It has taken us a long time to build up this reputation, and we must be very careful to maintain it.

214,2016-08-21 20:44:33,"At the same time, Singapore is good friends with China and hopes that China will develop and grow well too. Because an unstable and backward China will cause Asia great trouble, as happened in 1950s and 60s. Over the last 40 years, China has been stable and prosperous, and this has greatly benefitted Asia and the world, including Singapore.

We are working with China on their “One Belt, One Road” strategy; exploring opportunities in infrastructure, connectivity, financial services, urban planning and clean technology; and participating in the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank.
 
President Xi Jinping said recently the US and China should “cultivate common circles of friends”. This is precisely what Singapore is trying to do – to be among America’s circle of friends, and China’s too.

PM Lee: To start off with, we have to defend ourselves and that’s why we have the SAF. But we also need a network of friends. In our neighbourhood, with the big powers all over the world, and in faraway places.

That is why I have been busy with foreign trips this year. Beyond our neighbours, Malaysia and Indonesia, our most important friends include major powers like the US and China.

I just came back from an Official Visit to the US, at the invitation of President Obama. This was a significant gesture. My visit reflects Singapore’s warm and deep friendship with America, and was also a signal that the US values its friends and partners, and appreciates Singapore’s support for the role that America has played in the Asia-Pacific for more than 70 years.

We also need an overall strategy – to spot changes and respond to successive disruptions, to make our companies resilient and able to keep finding new ways to do business, and to prepare our workers to do different and new jobs during their working lives

That is what the Committee on the Future Economy (CFE), chaired by Ministers Heng Swee Keat and Iswaran, are doing.

It is not quite done, but I will give your a preview of 3 of the themes:

1. To help companies build new capabilities. The digital economy is one promising area.

2.To promote entrepreneurship as they play an important role in our society. Not just in creating jobs and prosperity, but with their resourcefulness and optimism, they give our society the confidence that “anything is possible”.

3. To develop a skilled workforce. That is why SkillsFuture is crucial. We are preparing our students well for the new economy, equipping them with relevant, in-demand skills. We are also offering courses to upgrade those already working and help them achieve deeper mastery.

Besides upgrading workers in their present careers, we are helping workers who get retrenched, or who change careers, to transition and find new jobs.

These are the ways our economy, and our workers, can thrive amidst disruption. This is how we can progress together, and thrive in a competitive and dangerous world.

PM Lee: We aspire to be among the leading cities like New York, Shanghai, London, Tokyo, Sydney. Yet at the same time, we want Singapore to be our home, where we belong and where our families feel safe and secure, where we build a compassionate and inclusive society, leaving no one behind.

But among all the economic issues we are dealing with, the defining challenge which we face in this era is “disruption”. Because of technology and globalisation, and disruption will happen over and over again, relentlessly.

We can respond to disruptive change in two ways: close ourselves off, and try to stop people from using the new technology; or, embrace change, and let the disruption happen, and adjust to it. 

Every industry is getting disrupted differently. EDB, SPRING Singapore, Infocomm Development Authority of Singapore - IDA and IE Singapore (International Enterprise Singapore) will work with industries and with the trade associations and chambers. They will develop specific programmes to help companies use new technologies and invest in skills.

My subjects will not all be easy or fun, and some sensitive topics may even make us feel a bit uncomfortable. But it is my responsibility to talk candidly about them, tell you honestly what lies ahead, and what we need to do to progress together.

I was taken aback. I thought for a while and replied: If we wish for material things, we will regret it, because after we have got it, we will not be satisfied and we will want more. But what I would like is that we be blessed with a divine discontent - always dissatisfied with where we are; always driven to do better. And yet, that we have the wisdom to count our blessings, so that we know how precious Singapore is, and we know how to enjoy and protect it.

If just these two wishes are fulfilled, that will be enough. Then we can keep on building something special in Singapore for many more years, and “Achieve Happiness, Prosperity, and Progress, for our nation”.

PM Lee: I am sharing my concerns and my plans with you because all of us have a role to play, building Singapore together.

Whom are we building this for? Not just for ourselves but for our children and our grandchildren. Singapore must be a place where millennials (young Singaporeans born in or came of age around 2000) can chase dreams, in their careers and also in family, which adds meaning to our lives.

We might think – can things get any better after SG50? Can the best yet to come? The answer is a resounding Yes! 

This year, we showed ourselves, and showed the world, what Singapore can be, beyond SG50. We are a nation where every Singaporean has a place, as we saw at the National Day Parade – regardless of race or religion, able-bodied or special needs – we stand together with pride, singing “Count on Me, Singapore!”, because we know we can count on one another.

With this spirit, Singapore will advance in our nation building journey. Some troubles will surely come, and I am sure that we will not be short of challenges. We will be tested as one people, and we must not be found wanting.

Because this is a multi-racial society and multiracialism is the fundamental reason why we became a nation in the first place.

总理说，新加坡能有今天的种族和谐，建国一代，尤其是华社，功不可没。他们和政府携手合作，奠定了一个多元、和谐社会的基础。经过多年的相处，大家在直觉上都明白各种族和宗教，都必须互相迁就，互相包容，才能维持现有的和睦。

不过我们的社会还没有完全达到对所有种族，无论肤色或语言，都一视同仁的理想。在条件相等的情况下，一位少数种族的候选人在华人占多数的选区竞选时，就会处于劣势。而新加坡，每个选区都是以华人居多。这也是我们实行集选区制度的原因。集选区制度确保了少数种族能在国会拥有他们的代议士。

总理说，要让一名非华族候选人当议员，已经很不容易。何况要一名非华族候选人当民选总统，就更困难。 所以，今年初，总理提议修改宪法，调整民选总统制度，其中就包括确保我国每隔一段时间，能有一位非华族的总统。

在现有的制度下，新加坡将来很可能长期没有非华族国人当选总统。这会削弱非华族同胞对国家的认同感， 影响我国社会凝聚力。这关系到新加坡的社会和谐，以及国家的发展与安全。所以，总理希望华族同胞会支持这个宪法的改革。这样，将来优秀的非华族人选，就能够成为国家元首，代表所有新加坡人。

总理说，调整我国的政治体系可让各个种族都有参与感， 都以身为新加坡国民感到自豪。这才能确保新加坡在面对各种挑战时，甚至是在危机发生时，大家可以更团结，从容应对。所以我们要坚守多元种族原则，让它延续下去。为下一代打造一个更美好，更灿烂的未来。

经过一番努力，我们已经看到了一些亮点，例如在一般制造业、家具设计、食品业等方面，有些传统公司转型 ，成功地向海外发展。总理也强调，危机也能带来转机。希望中小型企业能善加利用政府所推出的配套，进行转型，提升本地业绩或到海外发展。

除了帮助企业，总理也谈到政府推行的多项计划，跟企业合作，帮助工友调整，适应新环境。不少雇主也积极地帮助员工提升技能，借此提高生产力。另一方面，政府也帮助工友的家庭解决各种生活上的问题，让所有的家庭老有所养，壮有所用，幼有所长。

总理说，过去十年，政府推出了多项措施和配套，加强社会安全网。 政府尤其关心退休人事。因此，推出了终身健保和建国一代配套，帮助大家应付医药费。政府也改善了公积金终身入息计划(CPF Life)，提高了公积金存款利率，也推出了乐龄补贴计划。

但是，总理说，乐龄健保计划(ElderShield)还有待改善。因为现在，不是每个人都加入这项计划。总理说，卫生部将成立一个委员会来检讨这项计划。希望涵盖更多的人、提供更好的保障，同时确保保费是大家所负担得起的。

Dalam ucapan Bahasa Melayu, PM menekankan peri pentingnya masyarakat berbilang kaum Singapura untuk terus bersatu-padu.

Beliau turut menggesa agar masyarakat Melayu/Islam menguasai teknologi dan tidak lepaskan peluang untuk terlibat sepenuhnya dalam Ekonomi Baru. Beliau berharap masyarakat Melayu/Islam akan merebut pelbagai peluang untuk meningkatkan kemahiran dan taraf kehidupan melalui SkillsFuture.

PM juga menyentuh tentang ancaman keganasan yang semakin meruncing dan berbahaya di Singapura. Singapura terkenal sebagai negara yang berbilang agama dan rakyatnya bertolak ansur serta menghormati agama lain. Namun ada kalanya, pendakwah asing tidak faham konteks berbilang bangsa Singapura dan cuba memecahbelahkan keharmonian kaumnya. PM mengalu-alukan inisiatif masyarakat Melayu/Islam untuk memperkukuhkan Skim Pengiktirafan Asatizah (ARS) dan menjadikannya wajib bagi semua asatizah di Singapura. PM menyambut baik usaha dan azam masyarakat Melayu/Islam. Ini juga memberi jaminan dan meningkatkan keyakinan bahawa semua asatizah dapat membimbing pelajar mereka untuk mengamalkan Islam sesuai dengan konteks berbilang kaum Singapura.

Sebelum mengakhiri ucapannya, PM juga menarik perhatian kepada sistem Presiden Dipilih yang sedang diperhalusi untuk memberi peluang kepada kaum minoriti menjadi Presiden dari masa ke masa. Dengan keyakinan dan sokongan padu, barulah Presiden dapat melaksanakan peranan untuk menyatupadukan rakyat Singapura. 

Menggulung ucapannya, PM menekankan bahawa masyarakat Melayu/Islam adalah anggota penting yang telah banyak menyumbang kepada kesejahteraan dan kemajuan Singapura.

232,2016-08-17 18:03:22,"I am too old to have played with Super Soakers, but my children loved these powerful water guns when they were small. So this BBC article on the inventor caught my attention and brought back memories. 

It is an inspiring story of Lonnie Johnson, former NASA engineer and inventor. It tells how he invented not only the Super Soaker but also the Nerf toy gun, which were both hugely successful. He used his fortune in royalties to set up a scientific lab that is developing green batteries and a hydrogen powered engine.

Johnson’s story is especially remarkable, as he is an African American who grew up in the American South in the 1960s, when blacks were still discriminated against and downtrodden. But he had a natural sense of curiosity and a “never-say-die” attitude, and he made it. 

He also spoke of why we must expose the young to ideas, and let them experience success. This will foster self belief and grow more successes.

So let us celebrate small successes, have passion and keep doing what interests us. Keep trying, and if at first you fail, try again. You never know where your efforts will take you! - LHL",114,530,6185,1,42,174,0,27

Joseph’s win signifies much more than Singapore’s first Olympic gold medal. He sweated and sacrificed. With determination and fire in the belly, he has shown a new generation of aspiring athletes that dreams are worth striving for.  

Achievements, too, are more than medals. Many of our athletes have come away from the Olympics with new personal bests, and valuable experience going up against the world’s best. Swimmer Quah Zheng Wen set two new personal bests in the pool. Rower Saiyidah Aisyah (Aisyah Rower) reached the quarterfinals, finishing as 3rd best Asian competitor. Sprinter Timothee Yap and shuttler Derek Wong went up against Usain Bolt and Lee Chong Wei respectively - both the best in the world. They have worked hard, and they all deserve recognition for their efforts. 

The Games are still ongoing and our athletes are still competing in their respective events. I hope you’ll join me in cheering on our women’s table tennis team in their semifinal match taking place right now! - LHL

Besides the unicorn, the parade combined traditional and new elements in a rousing celebration of our nationhood in the new stadium. The items wove together our past, present and future, to present the story of our nation.

In my National Day Message, I talk about three of our challenges, and how we are tackling them: extremist terrorism, our continued prosperity, and ensuring good government.

However, our most fundamental success factor is not good plans or adequate resources. It is staying united and resolved to tackle challenges together, and make Singapore a better home for all.

This National Day, I hope each of us will reflect on what this unity means.

255,2016-08-06 21:01:40,"At my joint press conference with President Obama in Washington on Tuesday, we were asked about the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP). I shared my perspective from this side of the Pacific. 

The TPP is a deal. It is the outcome of a tough bargaining process that all 12 member countries have negotiated. Each agreed to improve market access to the rest, and commit to a set of common rules, in exchange for the others doing the same. 

It is not just about exports but also about imports. It will benefit consumers as well as producers. Our people will enjoy a wider range of products, services, and opportunities that will improve their livelihoods.

It also has a strategic dimension. It promotes interdependence instead of rivalry, and ultimately peace instead of war.

President Obama has been critical in pushing for the TPP. The deal will not only benefit American workers and businesses. It will show clearly that America will stay engaged in the Asia Pacific, and deepen ties with its many friends and allies in the region. – LHL",83,235,3409,2,4,75,0,15

50 years ago, we were newly independent, struggling to build a modern economy. America was divided over the Vietnam War. Mr Lee explained to the US why Asia mattered to America, and why their active engagement was crucial to the millions living in non-Communist countries in Southeast Asia. 

Today, thanks to US sacrifices and efforts, we live in a more peaceful, stable and prosperous region. Singapore’s relationship with the United States has flourished. We are partners in many areas - trade, defence, R&D, education, and are continually exploring ways to do more together. 

Most importantly, we enjoy strong people-to-people ties. So it is fitting that we are marking 50 years with a scholarship for student exchanges in each other’s countries. We have come far, and have many more things to do together.

Mr Chor belonged to the Pioneer Generation who built Singapore. He dedicated his life to the country and to improving the lives of Singaporeans. 

As a young man, he joined the PAP to fight for an independent Singapore. As MP for Bukit Timah, he saw the poor neighbourhood turn into a beautiful modern estate, and improved the lives of residents. 

Mr Chor’s integrity and character shone on many occasions. In 1956, when a 2,000 strong mob threatened to burn down the former Yeo Hiap Seng factory in Bukit Timah, he stopped them. He reminded them that they were against the colonialists and not the local manufacturer. 

Mr Lee Kuan Yew considered Mr Chor one of his oldest, most steadfast and courageous party comrades. He said that if he had to choose one other to go to battle with him, he would pick Mr Chor. 

After retiring in 1984, Mr Chor kept a watchful eye over his old constituency. I often met him when I visited Bukit Timah for constituency events, and was glad to see him again last year when we celebrated the 60th Anniversary of Bukit Timah.

I would like to express my deepest condolences to Mr Chor’s family at this time of sorrow. – LHL

Harmony between our different races and religions is a fundamental principle of our nation. We celebrate our diversity, and share each other’s customs and cultures.

Unfortunately, in many countries, we are seeing more cases where people reject diversity and inclusion. Just look at the extremist terrorist attacks in recent weeks - Orlando in the US, Dhaka in Bangladesh, Nice in France, Puchong in Malaysia - each incident chilling, driven by hatred, and heartbreaking. 

In Singapore, we must always stay united as one people, and never allow any such event to break or divide us.  – LHL

The mosque is roomy and airy, with a modern design and an inviting, open plan. It also has an auditorium, seminar rooms and a rooftop garden. As Punggol has many young families, Al-Islah created a special family prayer room where families can pray together. 

My thanks to Dr Wan Rizal, the Chairman of Masjid Al-Islah, for showing me around this beautiful mosque. Thanks also to the volunteers for working hard every day during Ramadan to cook and provide food for the congregants. - LHL

Hari Raya akan tiba seminggu lagi. Saya gembira kerana sempat bersama para jemaah Masjid Al Islah Punggol di majlis berbuka puasa malam tadi, disertai Menteri Yaacob Ibrahim dan AP Pasir Ris-Punggol, Sun Xueling. Masjid ini dibuka tahun lepas, sebelum bulan Ramadan. Kehadirannya amat dialu-alukan masyarakat Melayu/Islam di Punggol dan sekitarnya.
 
Masjid baru ini lapang dan nyaman. Ia juga berkonsep terbuka dengan ciri seni bina yang moden. Masjid ini juga dilengkapkan dengan auditorium, bilik seminar, serta sebuah taman di bumbung masjid. Cantik sekali! Demi memudahkan banyak keluarga muda di estet Punggol, Al-Islah menyediakan bilik khas untuk keluarga bersolat bersama.
 
Terima kasih kepada Pengerusi Masjid Al-Islah, Dr Wan Rizal, serta pasukannya kerana menjadi tuan rumah yang baik. Terima kasih juga kepada para sukarelawan yang bertungkus lumus setiap hari menyediakan juadah berbuka puasa yang lazat untuk para jemaah. – LHL",133,477,7371,1,5,195,0,34

SQ368, a Boeing 777-300, was enroute to Milan from Singapore but turned back to Changi two hours after take-off due to an engine oil leak. The Airport Emergency Service team were on standby when the plane landed and firefighters put out the fire promptly.

Yesterday’s Officer Cadet Course Commissioning Parade had added significance because we are commemorating SAFTI’s 50th anniversary. Particularly happy that SAFTI’s first batch of officers and instructors were there to celebrate this jubilee with us. 

At the first commissioning parade in 1967, Mr Lee Kuan Yew said: “What we lack in numbers, we will make up for in quality: in the standards of discipline, training, dedication and leadership”. And so we did. Over time, this became part of the SAF’s ethos.  

My deepest thanks to every soldier who exemplifies this spirit to the full, and keeps our country and families safe. Long may this continue. Happy 50th anniversary to SAFTI!

320,2016-06-26 10:00:00,"Read this thoughtful piece in yesterday’s The Straits Times. The writer reflects on her childhood days growing up in a kampung. She remembers fighting spiders with her cousins, free roaming chickens in the compound, and gathering twigs for her grandmother’s kitchen fire. But along with these idyllic scenes she also recalls the potholed roads, dirt, discomfort, and lack of basic sanitation that was the reality of kampung life. It reminded me of Jack Neo’s movie, Long Long Time Ago 2, that I watched recently (bit.ly/1OsCMic). 

The rapid pace of change, and the uncertainties of a globalised world, make us nostalgic for an older and seemingly simpler way of life. There is such a thing as a kampung spirit, which we should maintain in our modern lives. But kampung life was hard, and we are much better off today.

323,2016-06-24 15:53:43,"The UK vote to leave the European Union (EU) in the #Brexit referendum is a turning point. It reflects the anxiety of the British population over immigration, their resentment at having to negotiate with and accommodate European partners, and their desire to assert British identity and sovereignty. 

Other developed countries also face similar challenges as Britain. We all live in a globalised, interdependent world. The desire to disengage, to be less constrained by one’s partners, to be free to do things entirely as one chooses, is entirely understandable. And yet in reality for many countries disengaging and turning inwards will likely lead to less security, less prosperity, and a dimmer future.

The next few years will be uncertain ones for Britain and Europe. Leaving the EU is as complicated as joining it. What new arrangements will be made? Will Brexit hurt investor confidence more broadly, and the global economy? How will Britain’s leaving affect the rest of the EU? How will this affect us, living in Asia but part of the same globalised world?

It is too early to tell, but we need to watch developments carefully. Nobody can foresee all the consequences of the Brexit. 

The British voters have decided. We wish Britain well. I wish David Cameron well too, who has been a good friend of Singapore and has announced his intention to resign as PM.

Singapore will continue to cultivate our ties with Britain, which is a long standing friend and partner. We hope in time the uncertainty will diminish, and we will make the best of the new reality. - LHL",467,2814,15934,5,20,179,560,115

326,2016-06-22 10:00:39,"When was the last time you read a good book? I enjoy reading, but read less than I would like for pleasure. It is partly finding time, and also (if the book is serious) the effort of focussing on something not work related. But recently I have read several good books:

Ari Shavit’s My Promised Land: The Triumph and Tragedy of Israel, tells the story of Israel’s nation building and the conflict with the Palestinians through personal stories.

Operation Thunderbolt, by Saul David, is about the spectacular Israeli commando raid on Entebbe airport in Uganda, to rescue hostages after an aircraft hijacking, which happened exactly 40 years ago.

A Rage for Order, by Robert Worth, is about the Arab Spring, and how things have gone since then. Also told through personal stories, it brings home vividly the passions and struggles that combined to cause the upheavals in the Middle East.

I read these books partly because of my April trip to Jordan, Israel, and the Palestine Territories.

Having just been on holiday in Japan, and visited the tomb of Tokugawa Ieyasu, the daimyo (warlord) who unified Japan and founded the Tokugawa shogunate, I am now starting on a biography of him. Shogun, the Life of Tokugawa Ieyasu, by A L Sadler, was published long ago in 1937, but promises a fascinating read.

The National Library Board, Singapore encourages Singaporeans to read more, read widely and read together. They have launched a five-year National Reading Movement, and are offering more than 170 literary programmes and reading activities island-wide, in its annual “Read! Fest” which culminates in National Reading Day on 30 July.

327,2016-06-20 20:59:27,"Came across this The New York Times piece explaining why Berlin is a “playground paradise”.

It’s not just that the actual playgrounds are creatively designed, physically challenging and plentiful, but also the attitude of parents. German parents believe in giving their children the space for adventurous play — to explore, climb, build, and in the process, develop a sense of “selbstständigkeit” or self-sufficiency. 

The article describes how in the US (and I suspect in Singapore too), playgrounds are less challenging because parents are more protective of their kids. But it is good for children to learn through exploration and risk taking, and to take a few tumbles in the process. They will grow up more confident and resilient, better able to cope with unfamiliar or difficult situations. 

I asked the Housing & Development Board about this, because HDB builds many playgrounds in our housing estates. HDB tells me that they are trying out more interesting designs, like a forest-themed playground in Bukit Panjang, and a military-inspired design in Choa Chu Kang (where Keat Hong Camp used to be). I hope these will be popular with children and their parents, and will lead us to create many more fun spaces for kids! - LHL",185,521,5338,0,14,144,0,21

Fathers provide for us, support us, inspire us and lead us on the right paths. In many households, they are the head of the family, and carry much on their shoulders. But they also have to share with their spouses the housework and the duties looking after the children, especially nowadays with most couples both working. 

Today, spend time with your father, even if just to share what you did yesterday or what you plan for this week. We fathers enjoy hearing from our children, even about everyday, mundane things. Happy Father’s Day to all dads and dads-to-be! - LHL

Happy to visit the Singapore-Myanmar Vocational Training Institute (SMVTI) in Yangon yesterday. 

SMVTI came about when Myanmar leaders asked for our help in skills training. In 2014, both sides signed an MOU to set up the Institute. We assisted in building the premises, and also deployed 3 Institute of Technical Education, Singapore staff to develop the curriculum and help run the school. Companies from both countries have generously sponsored equipment and training facilities, and I hope more will do so.

The Institute trains skilled workers in hospitality and tourism, electrical skills and electronics, facilities management and engineering services. Entry to the six-month courses is very competitive, and I found the students bright and keen.

Jurong has quite a history. Once a freshwater swamp forest, it was cleared to build an industrial estate in the 1960s and 1970s. 

Today, we are redeveloping Jurong to make it a greener, more inviting place for families to enjoy. I mentioned some plans in my 2014 National Day Rally — the new Jurong Lake District, a new Science Centre, more community spaces, and the High Speed Rail terminal. 

When all these are ready, the Jurong Lake District will become a great place to live, work and play — no passport required. :)  – LHL",210,584,11913,1,13,305,1,74

The ASEAN-Russia Commemorative Summit in Sochi showed goodwill on both sides, and a shared desire to do more together.

I welcomed President Putin’s proposal for ASEAN, the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU) and the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) to explore the possibility of a partnership. Singapore is exploring our own bilateral SG-EAEU FTA, and we also encourage Russia to engage other ASEAN states individually.

Step by step, this will foster economic partnership, peace, stability and growth in all our countries and the region. – LHL

We talked about the terrorism threat, and how our agencies are cooperating to fight it together.

President Jokowi described his efforts to improve the business environment in Indonesia, including in the Batam, Bintan and Karimun region. I said that we valued our economic ties with Indonesia, and our investors appreciated the Indonesian government’s support for their projects. 

We looked forward to our next retreat later this year. Indonesia will be hosting, and we are hoping to visit Kendal, near Semarang in Central Java, where Sembcorp has a joint venture to develop a big industrial park.

My father believed that Russia would play a major role in world affairs. He first visited in 1970 and eventually came more than five times. Even after he retired as PM, he kept the links up. He served on the board of the SKOLKOVO - Moscow School of Management. He also was a keen supporter of the Russia-Singapore Business Forum.

So I am very happy to continue building on our good relations. Our trade has almost quadrupled in the last ten years. But in absolute size, it is still not huge. 

That is why Singapore signed an MOU with the Eurasian Economic Commission (EEC) yesterday. I hope this will pave the way for an FTA between Singapore and the region. 

Beyond trade, today we signed two MOUs: one between the Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth - MCCY and the Russian Ministry of Culture, and the other between Nanyang Technological University, Singapore and the Russian Academy of Sciences.

But because of their hard work, and their willingness to change, we built today’s Singapore.

“Nation building” sounds abstract and straightforward. But actually it was made up of the joys and sorrows, the blood, sweat and tears of so many individual families. Jack Neo told the story well - I am sure I was not the only one to tear up during the show.

This year we are celebrating May Day in a cautious mood. With the global economy slowing down, many workers are worried and anxious. This is an issue in Singapore too, with retrenchment a reality for some. We are watching this closely, and have measures to help workers retrain and find new jobs. 

One scheme is the Career Support Programme (CSP), proposed by Minister Lim Swee Say. The CSP provides wage support for a year, to defray hiring costs and encourage employers to try hiring PMETs who have been retrenched mid-career, and hopefully employ them longer-term. 

Another measure is to help our workers upgrade and uplift themselves. Secretary General Chan Chun Sing told me NTUC intends to raise $50 million to partner universities to teach new skills to mid-career workers, including PMETs. I told him if he can raise $50 million, the government will write the cheque for another $150 million, for a total of $200 million in the NTUC-Education and Training Fund. NTUC will start by partnering with NTU, with more universities later down the road.  

In these are times of rapid change, we must take our challenges seriously, but we should have confidence. The Government and Labour Movement are ready, and with the people’s support for our programmes, we can emerge stronger than before.

As Foreign Minister, he played a key role negotiating the 1993 Oslo Accords, signed by PM Yitzhak Rabin and PLO leader Yasser Arafat, which led to the creation of the Palestine Authority. For this, all three won the Nobel Peace Prize. Now 92, Mr Peres is still actively working with his organisation, the Peres Center for Peace, promoting peace in the region.

Yitzhak Rabin was assassinated in 1995, and I stopped by Rabin Square in Tel Aviv to pay tribute to him. He, too, was a great leader. The Oslo Accords were a key step towards a two-state solution, and I hope more progress will be made soon.

One modest way we can help the Palestinians  is through technical assistance. This is why we are doubling our Enhanced Technical Assistance Package from S$5 million to S$10 million.

Jordan has been a good friend to us from the beginning. It co-sponsored our membership in the UN in 1965. Our two nations share a mutual interest in fighting terrorism, including ISIS. 
 
Earlier, I visited Petra, “a rose red city half as old as time”. It is a fascinating place to explore, with lots of natural beauty, culture and history. It was built two thousand years ago, yet still holds lessons for us. An ancient people, the Nabataeans, built a thriving trade hub here.

407,2016-04-14 13:05:00,"At the Committee of Supply (COS) debate for PMO yesterday, Josephine Teo spoke about the importance of valuing and celebrating parenthood as a society. One point she made struck me: quite apart from financial incentives and practical considerations, a country’s Total Fertility Rate (TFR) depends also on historical and social factors, which are often not well understood. 

She gave the example of France, which has a TFR of 2.0 — one of the highest among developed countries. France has good social policies to support and encourage parenthood. But when Josephine visited France to study their experience, all the people she met gave one more explanation: ""1945"". France lost so many of its citizens in the Second World War (600,000 dead) that after the War ended in 1945, there was a strong desire - a national psyche - to repopulate the nation.

The TFR is a statistic, but it is made up of countless individual stories. I was reminded of the late Congressman Tom Lantos whom I met years ago. He was a Hungarian Jew and Holocaust survivor. He lost most of his family in the concentration camps. After the War, he emigrated to the US and became a Congressman. He had two daughters and 18 grandchildren. His daughters decided to give him as many grandchildren as they could, to make up for the family members killed.

Singapore is fortunate not to have experienced such calamities. Our TFR was 1.25 last year. We should do all we can to encourage couples to have more kids. Hence the enhancements to paternity leave, shared parental leave, and adoption leave that Josephine announced. They come into effect next year, so if you are thinking of having a baby (or another baby), now is the time to start trying! :) - LHL

Norway and Singapore enjoy good economic relations, especially in the maritime sector. Our ties go back more than a century. Norway established an honorary consulate here in 1906, soon after it became independent. As PM Solberg told me, the right to establish its own consulates overseas was the final issue which led Norway to dissolve its union with Sweden in 1905 and become an independent country. 

During her visit, PM Solberg spoke at the 6th Norway-Asia Business Summit, and gave a public lecture at The International Institute for Strategic Studies Asia (IISS Asia) – Fullerton Lecture Series.

It told the story of Xinyao, how it began with student groups in the old Nantah composing 诗乐 (poems to music) in the late 1970s, then became popular with JC students who were bilingual, and now has caught on with a new generation, and even beyond our shores in Taiwan. 

Xinyao's history is tied up with the changes in our society and education system, and the difficult time which that generation of Chinese-speaking Singaporeans had, in schools and at work, adjusting to the new economy using English as the working language. 

I found the movie moving and powerful. And I got a surprise bonus — in one scene I found my old Chinese teacher 黄伟光老师 teaching a class in Catholic High School!

The first anniversary of a person’s passing is a significant moment to remember him and reflect on what he meant to us. The more so with Mr Lee Kuan Yew. The Cabinet had discussed how we should mark the occasion. My advice was that we should leave it to ground-up efforts. Groups should keep their observances in proportion, and focussed on the future.

The Cabinet recognised the strong desire of many Singaporeans to show their respect for Mr Lee, and honour what he did for us. We reviewed the events and observances that different groups had planned, and agreed that they were generally appropriate. They expressed the sincerely felt sentiments of Singaporeans, which my Cabinet colleagues and I deeply appreciate.

The idea that I should wish to establish a dynasty makes even less sense. Meritocracy is a fundamental value of our society, and neither I, the PAP, nor the Singapore public would tolerate any such attempt.

His views were well sought after, including by the late Mr Zubir Said, in crafting the lyrics of Majulah Singapura.

Cikgu founded Angkatan Sasterawan ’50 (Asas ’50) to nurture interest in Malay literature, in Singapore and the region. He received numerous awards, including the Cultural Medallion for Literature in 1987 and the Long Service Medal in 1989.

We are grateful to Cikgu Ariff for his contributions to Singapore and the Malay/Muslim community. My deepest condolences to his family. - LHL

In the morning we held a ceremony in the Chamber of the old Parliament House, It was attended by past and current MPs, as well as former Parliament staff. It was a simple and moving observance.

In the afternoon, the Cabinet observed a minute of silence before we began our weekly meeting. I spoke briefly about Mr Lee Kuan Yew and what it was like to be in his Cabinet. You can watch my remarks here: youtu.be/q4n3ou0KSZ8

I have written to the Belgian Prime Minister, Charles Michel, to express our condolences and sympathies to the families of the victims, and to the Belgian people.

Minister K Shanmugam Sc had just spoken last week about tightening up counter-terrorism measures in Singapore. We face a severe threat in Southeast Asia. It is not a matter of if, but when, that an attack will take place here. Indeed, today’s attacks in Brussels happened even though the Belgians were on full alert. 

I hear that recently on a double decker bus, the driver stopped the bus, pointed at a bag left near the entrance and asked whose it was. The tension was palpable as he went round the second deck to try to identify the owner (whom he found). He then explained that we have to be vigilant about bags lying around, because of possible terrorist attacks, and the passengers murmured their assent. So the message is getting through to Singaporeans. - LHL

463,2016-02-28 11:30:41,"Deeply saddened by the passing of Mr Lee Khoon Choy, a member of the PAP Old Guard, at the ripe old age of 92.

Khoon Choy, whom we all knew as “KC”,  started off as a journalist with Nanyang Siang Pau in the 1950s. Mr S Rajaratnam recruited him to join the PAP. KC fought in the 1959 elections and won, thus beginning his long career in politics and the Public Service. 
 
Mr Lee Kuan Yew once described KC as a man who “had it” — a man of courage that did not melt under pressure. In the early 1960s when the PAP was battling pro-communist factions in the party, the pro-communists targeted KC. He received a letter with a bullet, a death threat. In 1961, thousands of Chinese school students staged sit-ins. They threw rotten apples at him and shouted, “李炯才, 进棺材 (Lee Khoon Choy, enter the coffin)!” KC did not buckle. He stood with the PAP and was loyal till the end.
 
KC also served as Ambassador and High Commissioner to eight countries. As Ambassador to Indonesia, he played a crucial role in thawing relations between Singapore and Indonesia. Singapore had hanged two Indonesian commandos who bombed MacDonald House in 1965 and killed innocent civilians. KC persuaded Mr Lee Kuan Yew to wear a batik shirt and scatter flowers at the graves of the two men in Jakarta. This conciliatory gesture enabled Mr Lee to establish a relationship with President Suharto. In recognition of his contributions, KC was awarded the Distinguished Service Order in 1990.  

After KC stepped down from public service, he returned to his first love — writing and painting. I was honoured to launch his book “Golden Dragon and Purple Phoenix” in 2013. 

KC believed that “every human being should know his own roots. A tree without roots cannot grow. Human beings are the same.” Indeed, as we remember his life, we remember our roots and what our pioneers like him did, to put Singapore on the path it is today. My deepest condolences to his family and loved ones. – LHL

With an ageing population and medical science advancing rapidly, it is timely for us to refresh the campus. So I was happy to launch the new Master Plan today, to build a new SGH to serve future generations. 

Amidst the new buildings we will preserve links to the past. The Bowyer block (in pic, with clock tower), built in 1926, will be at the centre of the new campus. It will be an icon to honour those who have given their lives to public healthcare, and to remind us of how SGH has been treating patients for two centuries. 

Revamping the SGH campus will take 20 years of hard work. It is a worthwhile effort to assure Singaporeans of continuing good, affordable healthcare.

500,2016-01-27 18:42:19,"Singapore needs good policies and good politics to succeed. Our political system is working now. But we must keep updating it to continue to have a high quality government in the longer term – one that is honest, competent and effective, that is always accountable to the electorate, and that upholds a multi-racial society.

In Parliament today, I announced 3 things we will do to ensure this:

First, we will increase the minimum number of opposition MPs, including Non-Constituency MPs, from 9 to 12 by the next election. We will also give them the same voting rights as MPs. This will in effect aid the opposition, giving their best losers more exposure and possibly building them up for the next round. But I believe this will be good for the government and good for Singapore. No ruling party and government should ever be afraid of open argument. Ultimately, Singapore will benefit from a contest of ideas.

Second, we will further reduce the average size of Group Representation Constituencies, and create more Single Member Constituencies. The GRC scheme ensures that we will always have at least a minimum number of minority race MPs in Parliament. But we have to find the right balance between big and small GRCs, and the right mix of GRCs and SMCs.

Third, we will review the elected President scheme — to keep the eligibility criteria up to date, to strengthen the Council of Presidential Advisors (CPA) which assists and advises the President, and to ensure that minorities have a chance to be elected President.

I spoke about this as well as our fundamental interests and international relations at the S Rajaratnam Lecture yesterday. The Lecture series is organised by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) Diplomatic Academy.

Compared to where we started off 50 years ago, Singapore’s position in the world has improved immeasurably. We are respected and successful. We enjoy good standing in the international community and we have friends from around the world.

For this, we have generations of MFA officers and Ministers to thank, starting with our first Foreign Minister, the late Mr S Rajaratnam, after whom the Lecture series is named. In fact, MFA has done such a good job that people hardly know they exist, until they lose a passport somewhere. :)

In the end, both our external influence and our domestic success comes down to us as individuals. In the words of Mr Rajaratnam, “Being Singaporean is a matter not of ancestry, but of choice and conviction.” If we have that conviction, we can achieve success for Singapore as one united people, we can have an effective foreign policy, and we can keep our little red dot shining bright in the world.

Thank you to Ambassador Ong Keng Yong for moderating the Q&A session. You can view my lecture here: y2u.be/a1Rq7Vv1bUk

Leng Joo left us suddenly when he had so much more to give. Singapore has lost a champion of the environment, leader of corporate social responsibility, and a fine photographer with a big heart. 

A passionate nature lover, Leng Joo often took photos of birds, dragonflies, plants, or ponds. The Singapore Botanic Gardens was one of his favourite places (and mine too). Some of his photos of the Gardens were submitted as part of our UNESCO bid. He and his CDL team provided valuable support in the bid, which could not have succeeded without him.

Mr Schmidt was a visionary leader and a strong supporter of closer relations between our countries. Mr Lee Kuan Yew described him as a 'clear-headed and tough-minded' leader who had a thorough grasp of important issues. They found common ground on many issues, and were close friends for four decades. 

In 2012, Mr Schmidt made the long journey from Hamburg to Singapore to meet my father. The two friends spent three days discussing world politics. It was to be the last time they met. Their conversation was recorded and included in the final chapter of “One Man's View Of The World”, the book my father published the following year.  

Mr Schmidt also had an acute musical ear. I recall one poolside dinner my parents hosted for him. As usual my mother had some classical chamber music playing in the background. That evening she had on J S Bach’s Goldberg Variations. In the midst of the conversation, he turned to my mother, and asked if the pianist was Glenn Gould, which indeed it was. My mother asked how he knew, and he said there was something unique about Glenn Gould’s playing style.

The fires involve commercial interests. That’s why Singapore passed the Transboundary Haze Pollution Act (THPA), so that we can act against the companies responsible. 

We appreciate Indonesia’s efforts to address the issue. We hope it will share information on the errant companies so that we can all work together to bring them to task.

When Singapore became independent, we were defenceless. We needed the British forces stationed here while we built up the SAF. But the British economy was in trouble, and their government wanted to withdraw from “East of Suez”, to ease the defence burden.

Denis Healey was the UK Defence Secretary, and a friend of Mr Lee Kuan Yew. He fought to keep British forces in Singapore as long as possible. 

The British bent over backwards to help us. British regulations required them to destroy surplus equipment, but Healey agreed to let us have their surplus equipment when British forces left Singapore. 

Healey also sold us the Hawker Hunter aircraft, and helped train our air force to operate and fly our first fighters. 

Mr Lee Kuan Yew described Healey as having a powerful intellect, “like a computer which kept on putting out new solutions as more data was fed in”. He later became the Chancellor of the Exchequer, and was described as “the best Prime Minister Britain never had”. 

My deepest condolences to his family on his passing. – LHL

Walaupun Bahasa Inggeris digunakan sebagai bahasa pengantaraan di Singapura, Bahasa Melayu dan Bahasa Ibunda lain memainkan peranan penting dalam menghubungkan kita kepada asal-usul, nilai dan budaya berbilang bangsa kita yang cukup kaya.

Sebab itu, saya gembira mengumumkan bahawa MOE akan menambah 50% dana bagi menggalak pembelajaran Bahasa Ibunda kepada $25 juta untuk tempoh lima tahun mendatang (2016-2020).  Sokongan tambahan ini pasti dapat mewujudkan sekitaran lebih baik bagi murid-murid kita mempelajari Bahasa Ibunda di luar lingkungan sekolah.  

Sejak 30 tahun yang lalu, kempen Bulan Bahasa mekar berkembang tahun demi tahun, melestarikan Bahasa dan Budaya Melayu melalui acara-acara menarik dan berinovatif. Syabas kepada pihak penganjur dan semua yang terlibat!

Mr Lee believed that education was key to breaking the cycle of poverty. He helped thousands of beneficiaries through the SBL Education Foundation. 
 
The Lodge helped the needy regardless of their religion, and collaborated closely with charities belonging to other faiths, such as Jamiyah and the Hindu Endowments Board. 
 
Mr Lee twice received the Public Service Star for his tireless efforts and good works. Even when he had a stroke and was hospitalised, he worried that his illness would delay help to the needy.

- School of the Arts, Singapore, School of Science and Technology, Singapore to cater to varied talents

Our spirit shone brightest when Mr Lee Kuan Yew passed away. It brought out so much in us, and on the day of his funeral, we were mourning Mr Lee’s passing, but also affirming what he stood for, and celebrating what he had achieved.

Having a child is a major responsibility but we will help you, because every Singaporean child is precious to us. We will do so in four ways:

1. We will help couples live closer to their parents by introducing a Proximity Housing Grant. Every Singaporean household will be eligible, whether first-time buyer or not. You will get the Grant when you buy a resale flat with or near your parents, or your married children.

2. We will increase the amount of the Baby Bonus, and give it for every child. This will provide more support for larger families.

3. We will increase the Medisave Grant for Newborns. It will be enough to cover MediShield Life premiums for the child until age 21, and also help with other healthcare expenses.

4. Fathers play a vital role in bringing up children. You have to do your part. Paternity Leave will be increased from one to two weeks. The Government will pay for the extra week of leave. We will implement it on a voluntary basis first, and the Public Service will volunteer straightway. 

The Baby Bonus, Medisave Grant, and Paternity Leave changes will apply with effect from 1 January 2015.

One sneak peek from his plan: Many people in their 60s want to work longer. The tripartite partners have been discussing this, and they have reached an agreement. We will pass legislation to raise the re-employment age from 65 to 67 by 2017.

PM Lee: We are going to do three more things to keep HDB flats affordable and accessible to all Singaporeans:

1. The income ceiling will be raised from $10,000 to $12,000 for HDB flats, and from $12,000 to $14,000 for ECs, so that more households can buy HDB and ECs. 

2. We will raise the household income ceiling for Special CPF Housing Grants (SHG) from $6,500 to $8,500 so that two-thirds of all first-timer households will qualify. We will also double the maximum SHG from $20,000 to $40,000. 

3. We will help those in rental flats to own a flat. With latest changes, first-timers can still afford a 2-room flat even if you earn below $1,000, if you hold a stable job and contribute to CPF regularly. The Fresh Start Housing Scheme will help second-timer rental households own a 2-room flat. The flat will have a shorter lease and stricter conditions on resale. A Fresh Start Grant will be provided to help pay for the flat. We will support the family with counsellors to guide them to solve their problems holistically. The family has to play its part, and show that they are putting their lives in order.

On our National Day, just recently on 9 August, one Indonesian newspaper published an overview of the relationship between Indonesia and Singapore.

This may not reflect the Indonesian Government’s view, but we have to take note of it. It is a deep seated mindset – that a little red dot should know its place in the world. That mindset will not disappear for a long time.

We have to stay on top of regional developments, and watch relations between the major powers in the region. We have been able to maintain our security and standing in the world because we have a strong SAF, successful economy, and good diplomats and leaders.

PM Lee: We knew right from the start that to strike out and blaze a path on our own, everyone had to pull their weight and be counted. That is why Mr Lee Kuan Yew exhorted us over and over again to become a rugged society. Our people must be robust and tough, able to take hard knocks, always striving to be better. No one owes us a living and we have to make our own way forward. 

But a rugged society doesn’t mean every man for himself. We are strong even though we are small, because we are strong together. The ethos of our society is that if you work hard, you should do well. At the same time, if you do well, we expect you to help others.

We must inculcate this same ethos in our young. That is why we encourage our children to play sports, and send them to adventure learning and character education – to bring up a generation who will grow up tough and able to work closely together.

We encouraged all the communities to come together, but yet gave each community space to maintain their own cultures and ways of life. When difficult issues arose, we dealt with them together. We made extra effort to ensure that every community could hold their own and not be left behind. 

Therefore, for SG50, every community in Singapore is celebrating because all have progressed with the nation. Each group is celebrating with other groups, because we are one united people.

When I appointed the Committee two months ago, I asked it to redraw the constituency boundaries, to have smaller Group Representation Constituencies (GRCs), and at least 12 Single Member Constituencies (SMCs). The Committee was also to take into account population shifts and new towns that have come up.

They have done so. They have added one SMC and one GRC, giving a total of 13 SMCs and 16 GRCs. 

We will have more 4-member GRCs (6 instead of previous 2), and fewer 5-member GRCs (8 instead of 11). 

To make smaller GRCs and more SMCs, some boundaries have had to be changed. This will be the electoral configuration in the next general election. 

Wherever the boundaries may be drawn, MPs should serve the residents they represent to the best of their ability. And voters should support the candidates or teams who will best represent their interests, both in the constituency and as the government of Singapore.

I joked that Singapore is such a small country that even if we all stopped breathing it would make little difference to climate change. More seriously, we have few options for renewable energy. There is no space for nuclear power, and other sources are either not feasible (wind, hydro) or limited in scale (solar), so we have to rely heavily on fossil fuels.

But we will be a responsible member of the global community, and help to build consensus on an international agreement which is fair and implementable for all countries. 

Also each of us can make changes to our lifestyles, to save energy. Every little bit counts. - LHL

Meng Quang served Singapore with distinction. He headed EDB's Tokyo office, and was a consummate salesman for Singapore. He was fluent in English, Mandarin and Japanese, and landed major investments from Japan, including the Seiko watch factory.

MQ also played a key role in the decision not to pursue highly pollutive industries in Singapore. In the 1970s, foreign investors had proposed building an iron and steel complex on Pulau Ubin, but he advised against the plan. The project was reconsidered, and eventually called off. So in a sense, MQ saved Pulau Ubin.
 
Later MQ served as our Commercial Representative in Beijing. When we established formal diplomatic ties with China, he was in the team which negotiated the terms. He then continued as our Charge d’Affaires in Beijing. He accompanied me on my trips to China, and gave me good advice.

The program is pretty basic: it runs at the command prompt, in a DOS window. Type in the data line by line (e.g. 1-3-8---6), then the solver will print out the solution (or all the solutions if there are several), the number of steps the program took searching for the solution, plus some search statistics.

For techies: the program does a backtrack search, choosing the next cell to guess which minimises the fanout.

Here’s a question for those reading the source code: if x is an (binary) integer, what does (x & -x) compute?

Hope you have fun playing with this. Please tell me if you find any bugs! – LHL

#SmartNation

===========

Answer: As several of you noted, (x & –x) returns the least significant ‘1’ bit of x, i.e. the highest power of two that divides x. This assumes two’s complement notation for negative numbers, as some of you also pointed out. e.g. if x=12 (binary 1100), then (x & -x) = 4 (binary 100). I didn’t invent this; it is an old programming trick. :)

858,2015-04-09 22:00:42,"Visited Mr Bernard Chen’s wake this evening. 

Bernard contributed to Singapore in many roles – as a civil servant in EDB and MOF, as a Minister of State (in Mindef), as an MP (for Radin Mas and later Clementi in West Coast GRC), and in the private sector. Being a grounded, hardworking and humble man, he had friends from all walks of life.  

I first met Bernard nearly 40 years ago, when my father brought me along for a visit to Iran and Egypt. Bernard was in the delegation and we became friends. Later when I entered politics, Bernard as a senior MP was always supportive and generous with his advice. 

I was sorry to hear from ESM Goh Chok Tong in January that Bernard had cancer. When my father died a fortnight ago, Bernard wrote to me. I was moved. Despite his illness, Bernard made the effort to console me, and to explain that he was unable to pay his personal respects to Mr Lee because he was terminally ill. 

I replied to Bernard thanking him for all that he had done over the years. I said that we each have to make our journey through life, and live it so that when it is complete, we can say with good conscience that we have done our part.  Bernard had definitely done more than his fair share and contributed much to Singapore. I counted it my privilege to have been his colleague and friend all these years. 

Bernard was a staunch Catholic, so I ended my letter with the Latin blessing Dominus vobiscum – The Lord be with you. Rest in Peace, Bernard. – LHL

860,2015-04-08 18:03:39,"Making several Cabinet changes today. 

I am promoting Masagos Zulkifli to full Minister. He has performed well, both in his ministries and as an MP in Tampines. It is the first time we are having two Malay full ministers, which reflects the progress of the Malay community.

Other changes are because Chan Chun Sing is taking over as Secretary-General of NTUC from Lim Swee Say. So Swee Say goes to Manpower, and Tan Chuan-Jin goes to Social and Family Development. (Chun Sing also gives up his post of Second Minister in MINDEF, which Lui Tuck Yew will take over.) 

Swee Say has done a lot in NTUC: helping workers to upgrade themselves, finding them new jobs when they are retrenched, assuring them that they do not face globalisation and international competition alone. Chun Sing will have much work to do building on what Swee Say has done, but I am confident that he is up to the task.

These changes are part of continuing leadership renewal, to build a strong ‘A’ team for Singapore.

The date was 26 September 1958. My father was still practising as a lawyer in Lee & Lee. He was in Sibu (Sarawak) doing some cases, and was expected home. He sent this telegram to Lee & Lee (whose telegraph address was KYLEGAL SINGAPORE). It read simply “ARRIVING TODAY BATTLESHIP = LEEKUANYEW”. 
 
My mother did not understand the message. Was my father coming home on a battleship? The Lee & Lee secretary called the British Naval Base at Sembawang to check if any battleship was arriving from Sarawak, but they knew nothing about it. 
 
My father did arrive home that day, but not by battleship. He explained that he wanted steam boat for dinner, but as “steam boat” was two words, and telegrams were charged by the word, he wrote “battleship” instead, to save words and money! Sadly, since we had not understood the message, we did not have steam boat for dinner that night. :) - LHL

We rely on free market competition, yet every citizen is assured of good education, healthcare, housing, and retirement. We all have to work hard and save for ourselves and our families, but nobody is left to fend for ourselves alone. 

The Government creates conditions for a vibrant economy and good jobs. It builds effective, affordable social safety nets. But it avoids mortgaging our future, and burdening our children’s generation with debts.

We are strengthening our social safety nets, with MediShield Life, Silver Support, etc. But let’s not forget we are not scrapping a bad system, but improving a good one. - LHL",373,2176,21593,0,0,0,0,0

Eng Hen told the story of Lithuania, a small Baltic state close to Russia. In 2009, Lithuania ended military conscription (their form of NS). It had joined NATO, and assumed that its neighbourhood was peaceful. But after seeing Russia annex the Crimea and the war in Ukraine, Lithuania has now re-introduced conscription to build up its armed forces. 

When it comes to defence, we must never let down our guard. As Eng Hen said, by the time danger is upon us, it will be too little and too late to build up a defence.

The price of freedom is eternal vigilance. I salute all our SAF servicemen, who let us sleep peacefully at night.

Yong Yong cast the question in a broader perspective: whether it is right to think of the CPF as “our money”, to be spent solely as we choose. She explained how choice always comes with responsibility, and benefits always carry obligations. When we exercise personal choice (e.g. by spending our CPF savings early), there is a price to be paid (e.g. we may not have enough to support ourselves in old age), and that price should not be paid by someone else (e.g. other taxpayers).

Yong Yong had asked me earlier whether we had settled the CPF policy, and if so was it worth her while to speak. I said we had worked out the main changes, but strongly encouraged her to express her view and contribute to the public debate. I am glad that she did, and to such good effect.

“家”

农历新年是阖家共庆的佳节。在这喜庆节日，大家能深切体会到家的温馨。家中晚辈会向长辈拜年表达感激之意，并献上祝福，大人则会给晚辈发红包或压岁钱以示关爱，一家人开心庆团圆，沉浸在简单的幸福中。

正因为这个节日背后的深刻意义，即使我们工作忙碌、正在远行或是人在他乡，无法与家人一起吃团圆饭，我们也要尽力设法与家人保持联系。在这华人一年之中最重要的节日，我们不妨花点时间思考，生命中最重要，最珍贵的东西究竟是什么？家，对你而言又有着怎样的意义？

政府正竭尽所能协助国人建立温馨和乐，同时凝聚力强的家庭。我们通过“结婚与生育配套”，鼓励已婚夫妇生儿育女，并为家长们提供可负担得起的托儿和学前教育服务。我们希望今年新加坡会迎来很多金禧宝宝！为了鼓励多代家庭同住一个屋檐下，在生活中互相扶持，我们推出了三代同堂家庭组屋单位。我们也通过具有针对性的住屋津贴，鼓励年轻夫妇住靠近父母。另外，我们也透过建国一代配套、乐龄补贴计划和终身健保计划，来协助需照顾年长父母的子女减轻负担。

除了我们的家人和亲属，我们也应该加强新加坡这个大家庭的凝聚力。国人应该互相照顾，并向社会上的不幸人士和弱势群体伸出援手。我们正努力加强社会安全网，这包括协助低收入家庭拥有自己的房子。另外，今年底终身健保计划推行后，国人在面对庞大医院帐单时将不必担心付不起医药费。政府也检讨了公积金终身入息计划，协助各个家庭更好地规划退休生活。我们也扩大了就业补助计划，为低收入工友和他们的家人提供更多的支持。政府和社会人士将为需要援助的国人承担更多风险，让这些人士能更安心生活。我们会齐心协力，确保这些人不被抛在后头。

这些政策不是要取代家庭扮演的角色，而是为了协助维系家庭的向心力。我们不希望看到家庭关系变得薄弱；在其他一些社会，由于政府为家庭承担起更多责任，反而削弱了家庭关系。我们绝不能让这种情况发生在新加坡——不论是个别的小家庭乃至我们的新加坡大家庭。

凝聚力强的家庭是我国社会的基石。家庭成员之间互相照顾、互相影响、同甘共苦。家，激励我们向上向善，为自己也为家人谋取幸福。不论我们健康或病弱，不论我们处在顺境或逆境，我们的家会一直守护着我们，关心着我们。

单凭慷慨的社会政策或津贴，并不能打造幸福美满的家庭。家，不仅仅是我们和亲人之间关系的代名词，它更深层的意义在于我们如何维系亲情。因此，让我们用心经营我们的家：多抽空陪伴家人、教育孩子、尊敬和照顾年长的父母，以及积极帮助身边的人。

只要我们各尽本分，新加坡必将继续昌盛繁荣，不仅是取得经济上的繁荣，也能在这个多元社会，共筑一个和乐融融，和谐温馨的大家庭。。

最后，祝大家新年快乐！- 李显龙

“Our Family”

Chinese New Year is a time to celebrate with our families. It is a time to reflect on the blessings of having a family – to thank our elders for what they have done for us, to appreciate our spouses, to shower love on our children. It is a time to enjoy the simple goodness of family.   

So even if we may be busy, travelling or living in far flung lands, unable to come together physically for the New Year reunion, let us make the effort to connect with one another. On this most important festival in the lunar calendar, let us pause and remind ourselves of what truly matters in life, of what it means to belong to a family.   

The Government is doing all it can to help people build strong families. We are encouraging couples to have more children. The Marriage and Parenthood Package will support them, as will more affordable childcare and pre-schools. This year, we look forward to celebrating the birth of many Jubilee babies. We are encouraging three-generation families to stay close-knit, and making it easier for young couples setting up home to live close to their parents, through targeted housing grants. The Pioneer Generation Package, Silver Support and MediShield Life will lighten the burden on families taking care of elderly parents.  

Beyond our immediate family and relatives, we should also strengthen our larger national family. Singaporeans need to take care of one another, and especially of fellow citizens who are vulnerable or less fortunate.  We are strengthening our social safety nets. We have made it easier for low-income families to own their homes, introduced MediShield Life to give more protection against large hospital bills, reviewed CPF Life to help families better prepare for retirement, and expanded Workfare to support low-income workers and their families. The state and the community are bearing more risk on behalf of individuals, to give those who need help more peace of mind.  We are all in this together.  

We are doing all this to help our families stay together, not to supplant the role that families play. Our family ties must not weaken, unlike what we have seen in other societies where the state has taken on more responsibility. We must not let this happen in Singapore – either to our individual families, or to our larger national family. 

Strong families are the bedrock of our society. Family members not only take care of each other. They laugh and cry together.  Every member is shaped by every other. Our families inspire us to be better, not just for ourselves but for each other. Our families are always there for us, in sickness and in health, for better or for worse.

Generous social policies and grants by themselves do not grow strong or happy families. A family is not just about whom we are related to, but how we relate to each other. Therefore, let us make the effort to build strong families – to spend time with each other, nurture our children, respect and care for our elderly parents, and through our deeds help those in greater need. 
 
If each of us plays our part, Singapore will continue to prosper and do well, not just economically, but as a harmonious and cohesive national family, diverse yet one. 

Happy Chinese New Year! – LHL

Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong has been diagnosed with prostate cancer, and will undergo surgery to remove his prostate gland on Monday 16 February 2015. The robot-assisted keyhole prostatectomy will be carried out by Prof Christopher Cheng, the lead Urologist at the Singapore General Hospital (SGH).
 
In January, Mr Lee had undergone an MRI of the prostate which showed suspicious lesions. A subsequent biopsy found that one out of 38 samples contained cancer cells. 
 
Mr Lee decided on the surgical treatment option on the advice of a panel of doctors led by Prof Cheng, and is expected to recover fully. 
 
Data from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Centre show that patients with similar medical profile and treatment have a cancer specific survival rate of 99% at 15 years.

Dr Koh was one of our education pioneers. He was the first Dean of Science at NUS, and before that the Head of Department of Chemistry and Dean of Science at Nanyang University (Nantah).
 
As MP, Dr Koh saw Nee Soon transform from a rural area into an HDB new town. He helped new residents to settle in, tackled the many teething problems like public transport and defects in the new HDB flats, and made sure their needs were looked after. 
 
He was one of the Chinese educated MPs who kept us close to the Chinese ground. Others like him were Yeo Toon Chia, Ho Kah Leong, and Chng Jit Koon. Many were Nantah graduates, like Dr Koh. One difficult decision they had to make was to support the reforms in the late 1970s that merged Nantah with NUS, and led eventually to the formation of NTU. 
 
Today we no longer have “Chinese educated” MPs, but many MPs speak Mandarin as a result of our bilingual policy. Our education system has progressed, and so has Singapore, thanks to Dr Koh and his generation.
 
My deepest condolences to his wife and family. – LHL
 
昨晚慰问了前议员高立人博士的家人。高博士曾担任义顺选区(1979-1988年) 和义顺南选区 (1988-1996年) 的国会议员，直到它被纳入宏茂桥集选区为止。
 
高博士是我国教育界的先驱，是新加坡国立大学(国大) 理学院的首任院长。之前曾担任南洋大学（南大）化学系主任及理学院院长。
 
当年的义顺是农村、有园林。在高博士的领导下，逐渐把它发展成崭新的组屋区。刚迁入新社区的居民面对不少困难，公共交通不足，新的房屋有缺陷等等。高博士很仔细的帮助这些居民，解决生活上的不便。
 
高博士自己是受华文教育的。像他出自华校的议员包括楊敦清、何家良、庄日昆。很多跟高博士一样，也是南大毕业生。当时，这群南大议员做出了重大的决定，很不容易，因为他们选择了支持教育改革，把南大与新大合并，多年后又改组，最后成立了南洋理工大学。
 
现在，我们已经没有所谓的受华文教育的议员，不过施行双语政策后，多位议员都能讲流利的英语和华语。
 
我们的教育制度改善了，新加坡也进步了。这些都是高博士和他那一代努力的成果，感谢他们为我们的付出。
 
这里向他的妻子和家人表示我最深切的哀悼。 - 李显龙

On Monday, IPS Director Janadas Devan gave a vivid account of the events leading up to Singapore’s independence on 9 August 1965. His conclusion struck a chord with me: that there was nothing inevitable about our separation from Malaysia. In fact our founding leaders had believed that Singapore could not possibly survive without a hinterland. The flow of events might well have ended up with “one country, two systems” and quite a different Singapore. 

Today we are in a much better position than in 1965, but we are still a vulnerable, small country in Southeast Asia. The dangers we avoided long ago are not permanently gone, but remain potential possibilities. If we forget our history, they may come back, and we will have to relearn painful lessons.

He told me that he used to run a coffee shop in Hock Lam Street, and that my parents would drop by from their law office nearby to buy the 五香灌肠 (ngoh hiang guan chang).

In 1983, Singapore started building the MRT. Dr Fam chaired the Mass Rapid Transit Corporation (MRTC). The team completed the North-South and East-West Lines well within budget, two years ahead of schedule.
 
He was also chairman of the HDB from 1975 to 1983. Amidst a construction boom, contractors were reluctant to bid for HDB projects. But thanks to Dr Fam’s guidance, the HDB introduced pre-fabrication and mass production techniques, and got the housing programme back on track.
 
He sat on the Council of Presidential Advisers for many years and was also the founding chairman of the Nanyang Technological Institute, now NTU.

The Mosque-Cathedral has a fascinating history. Originally a church stood  there. When Muslim armies invaded Spain, they built a mosque on the foundations of the church. Over centuries, the Muslim rulers of Andalusia progressively expanded the mosque into a huge building that could hold 50,000 worshippers. After the Christians reconquered Córdoba in 1236, they re-consecrated the Great Mosque back to a cathedral. The influence of both religions is evident in the mix of Islamic motifs and Christian imagery.

-----------------------------

Here is an English translation of the Zaobao article:
 
By selecting a nearby neighbourhood secondary school, high scoring student saves on travelling time to spend more time on school work and family
 
When the PSLE results were released, 13-year-old Goh Wei Ling did not have to worry about which secondary school to apply for. This was not because her high score of 261 allowed her entry into any school of her choice, but because she had already made up her mind to apply for Evergreen Secondary School, a neighbourhood school that was next to her home.
 
This time last year, Wei Ling’s teachers and school mates thought she was “wasting” her chances but both she and her father, Mr Goh Poh Ling, a 68-year old taxi driver, thought it was a “worthwhile” choice.
 
Mr Goh said that his daughter could have gone to any school, but this one was the closest to home, and thus the most suitable. “If she went to a school further away, the journey there would have taken at least one hour, and a return trip would be two hours. That would have amounted to 730 hours in a year. Who would find the time to do their school work?” 
 
From her home in Woodlands Street 83, Wei Ling, who is now in Secondary One, takes just 5 minutes to walk to school everyday. The time she saves on traveling is spent on school work and with her family. “Lights out” is at 9.30pm and her family life is disciplined and healthy. 
 
Wei Ling said, “Rather than a school’s name or reputation, what matters more to my parents are good moral values. Every day, I spend most of my time with my family, and not on travelling. Ever since I was in Primary Four, I had already wanted to attend Evergreen and it is better than what I imagined.”
 
Wei Ling’s elder brother graduated from Evergreen, and was the school’s head prefect. He did well in his ‘O’ Levels, scoring eight A1s. Mr Goh related with pride how his children did not receive any tuition, as he could neither afford the fees nor the time. “For me, nothing is more important than a good upbringing, and the neighbourhood schools are not bad. If the child works hard, they can achieve good results, too. I am not from the Ministry of Education, but I believe that every school is a good school.” 
 
Brand name schools are attractive, but in the eyes of Mr Goh, what is more important is the sort of environment that suits the child. 
 
“If the child has the ability, they can go anywhere. Brand name schools are good, but the competition there is also strong. You may be first elsewhere, but be pushed down by the tougher environment. As parents, we should not let our children feel belittled. Instead, let them feel empowered. I will not insist that my children become doctors. Whatever she chooses to do, I will support as long as her heart is set on it.”
 
Wei Ling added that while many people may feel that neighbourhood schools are not as good, she disagrees. “I like Evergreen Secondary School very much and I have learnt a lot about life and being a better person here.”
 
Parent wants his child to be less tired
 
Siti Nurjaslina Bte Jeffry, 13, also performed well at last year’s PSLE. She chose to go to Fuhua Secondary School. Not only is it near her home, she was also attracted to their shooting CCA.
 
Even though she did not make it to the CCA, Siti was not disappointed as there were many other interesting CCAs she could choose from, and she now enjoys being part of the Malay Cultural Group. 
 
Siti’s father, Mr Jufri, a 44-year-old technician, said, “Life is already stressful in Singapore. I hope my children will not be too stressed. Her results could have gotten her into a brand name school, but she will be very tired. I don’t want her to be worn out. When you are under pressure, it will also be difficult to make friends and enjoy their friendship.”",228,859,7256,0,0,1,0,0
1006,2014-12-20 18:00:31,"I visited the Battle for Merger exhibition in October. This was the book of Mr Lee Kuan Yew’s radio talks in 1961, explaining what the fight against the Communists was about, and why Singapore needed Merger with Malaya. 

The Communist Party of Malaya (CPM) was a violent, illegal organisation. So it operated secretly, underground. But the Communists infiltrated open, legal organisations like trade unions, student associations and political parties. These supported the Communist cause, but denied that they themselves were Communist. Mr Lee exposed this Communist united front tactic.

I took these photos of a fascinating exhibit: a pair of original handwritten documents. One was a trade union document, signed 林清祥 Lim Chin Siong. He was the leader of the Barisan Sosialis, the main open front political party. The other was a Communist study cell document, signed 王明 Wang Ming. The handwriting was identical. In fact Wang Ming was Lim Chin Siong’s party name; Communist cadres took party names to conceal their real identities. So Lim Chin Siong was a Communist, and the Barisan Sosialis was Communist controlled.

This was more than 50 years ago. Many old Communist and pro-Communist activists have reconciled with their past, and become good citizens. But a few hard core ones still deny these historical facts. They don’t want to admit that they had fought on the wrong side, and that luckily for Singapore they lost. Some “revisionist” historians make this argument too. One motivation: cast doubt on the legitimacy of the PAP government, not just in the 1960s, but today.

The British have been declassifying documents from their archives in London, and making them available to the public. Also senior CPM leaders like Chin Peng, Eu Chooi Yip, Fong Chong Pik (aka the Plen) and others have published memoirs. Their first person accounts, like the British documents, confirm the extent of the Communist united front in Singapore, and leave no doubt that the Barisan was formed at the instigation of the CPM, and that Lim Chin Siong was a Communist cadre.

We have put together an account using evidence from the British archives as well as CPM sources, which confirm that Mr Lee Kuan Yew told the truth. Here it is, for your weekend reading. http://bit.ly/16BGul3 – LHL

总理说没有刻苦耐劳的建国一代，就没有今天的新加坡。 我们应该饮水思源，用一个恰当的方式，向建国一代表达我们的一份谢意。政府推出特别配套，希望能为建国前辈带来生活上的帮助。 
 
政府的另一大目标，是确保大家有足够的退休金，可以安享晚年。这个可以通过公积金制度和住屋政策两大政策来达到目的。总理说政府了解一些国人对公积金制度有一些见解，所以将调整公积金制度，使它更加完善，可以更好的帮助人民。总理说另一个能够保障国人晚年生活的政策就是居者有其屋政策。政府也会继续调整这些措施，尽量帮助国人利用房子来养老。总理将会在英语的演讲中进一步地解释这些政策。
 
总理也强调政府要让国人对未来充满信心和希望。无论国人处在哪一个起跑点，都有机会提升自己。在职场上一边工作，一边学习，也能出人头地。政府的教育目标，是要让人们按照自己的兴趣、专长和天赋，追求一个适合自己的学习道路，使自己的才华得到最充分的发挥。
 
要有好的生活，总理说，我们一定要有蓬勃的经济来进一步拓展国内和国际市场，特别是亚洲新兴的经济体，包括日益强盛的中国。政府会通过论坛促进新中企业交流，加深新加坡企业对中国的了解，促进新中两国创业者之间的合作。
 
总理说，新加坡华族，因为文化背景相近，以及具备双语能力，可以更容易融入中国社会。一直以来，政府也不遗余力支持民间组织，推广华族文化和母语教育。总理说，我们的宗乡会馆就做了很多工作，积极提倡文化和教育事业。政府会全力支持宗乡总会提出设立华族文化中心的构想。总理会在下个月为中心主持动土仪式。
 
华族文化中心所推广的文化，除了传统和现代中华文化，也将涵盖新加坡独特的华族文化。经过多年的酝酿，新加坡华族文化已经逐渐形成一种南洋风格。 
总理说，新加坡已经步入了第一世界，但是我们还没有发展到极限；我们还有无限发展的空间。我们需要的是先辈那种勇于开拓、积极进取的精神，新加坡才能攀上另一个高峰。
让我们朝着这个方向一起前进，共同努力。

1187,2014-08-17 19:05:29,"Rapat Hari Kebangsaan 2014 – Ucapan Bahasa Melayu 

Dalam ucapan Bahasa Melayunya, PM telah mengulangi penghargaannya kepada golongan Perintis Melayu.

Encik Lee menekankan bahawa warga Perintis Melayu sebenarnya ada pilihan (samada untuk menyertai Malaysia atau kekal di Singapura) apabila Singapura Merdeka. Tetapi mereka memilih untuk jatuh-bangun bersama Singapura sehingga negara ini mekar menjadi sebuah masyarakat berbilang kaum dan agama yang unik – yang bersatu padu dan harmoni. Beliau mengulangi penghargaannya kepada golongan Perintis Melayu kerana yakin dengan masa depan Singapura dan bertungkus-lumus dengan kaum lain, membangunkan Singapura.

Salah seorang tokoh Perintis Melayu cemerlang yang disebut PM ialah Encik Yusof Ishak, Presiden pertama Singapura. PM mengumumkan 3 bentuk penghargaan sebagai menjunjung budi dan pengorbanan Encik Yusof kepada Negara:

Pertama, sebuah masjid baru di Woodlands akan dinamakan “Masjid Yusof Ishak”.

Kedua, Institut Pengajian Asia Tenggara bakal dikenali sebagai “ISEAS – Institut Yusof Ishak”. 

Ketiga, NUS akan memulakan “Kerusi Profesor Yusof Ishak dalam Sains Sosial”. 

Dalam ucapannya, PM turut menarik perhatian tentang kemajuan besar yang dicatat masyarakat Melayu/Islam sepanjang 50 tahun lalu. Ini ketara melalui contoh-contoh individu Melayu/Islam yang berjaya saban tahun. 

PM juga menarik perhatian tentang penekanan pemerintah untuk menghargai setiap individu berdasarkan sumbangannya dan bukan hanya kelayakannya. PM mengumumkan pembentukan Jawatankuasa ASPIRE yang akan bantu rakyat menggilap potensi mereka melalui pembelajaran sepanjang hayat dan latihan kemahiran khususnya buat pelajar ITE dan politeknik. Ini agar setiap rakyat berpeluang untuk majukan diri dan perbaiki kehidupan mereka.

Menggulung ucapannya, PM yakin masyarakat Melayu/Islam akan mencatat kejayaan demi kejayaan jika mereka terus bersatu-padu. PM menyeru agar masyarakat Melayu/Islam menjunjung semangat golongan Perintis, perkukuh masyarakat berbilang kaum kita dan memperteguh komitmen untuk membentuk Singapura yang lebih baik buat semua.

The loss of innocent lives is tragic and painful. The Middle East is far away, but still we empathise with the pain and suffering of the Palestinian people, because of our common humanity.
 
Alas there is no easy solution. The Israel-Palestinian problem goes back almost a century. The distrust and enmity are mutual, and deep. Yet there is no future in this endless cycle of violence and retribution. 
 
Any lasting solution must begin with restraint and an end to violence, by both sides. I hope all parties will work together to stop this latest episode of violence.

Konflik bersenjata di Gaza semakin meruncing sepanjang seminggu ini. Ratusan nyawa terkorban, kebanyakannya orang awam termasuk ramai kanak-kanak dan bayi.

Walaupun Timur Tengah begitu jauh, kita dapat rasakan kepahitan dan kesengsaraan yang ditanggung rakyat Palestin kerana ikatan kemanusian yang kita semua kongsi bersama.

Tiada huraian mudah. Masalah Israel-Palestin berakar umbi hampir seabad lamanya. Mereka saling tidak mempercayai dan permusuhan begitu mendalam. Lingkaran keganasan dan tindak balas yang tiada penghujung tidak menjanjikan masa depan yang baik untuk rakyat. 

Sebarang huraian jangka panjang mesti bermula dengan kedua-dua pihak menghentikan keganasan. Saya harap semua pihak bekerjasama untuk akhiri gelombang keganasan terbaru ini.

Chuan-Jin explained how the CPF Minimum Sum gives Singaporeans a steady stream of income in retirement. He dispelled some common misunderstandings about the Minimum Sum. e.g. did you know that if you own a house, you don’t need to set aside $155,000 - the full Minimum Sum – in cash, but only half - $77,500, and that you could cover the rest with a property pledge?

He later ran NTUC News and edited the PAP publication Petir. He was a professional journalist, with a good feel for the ground and a knack for getting on with people.

Victor was a well-loved ventriloquist and entertainer. Very sad to learn that he passed away after a long battle with cancer. Victor and his puppet, Charlee, often performed at events I attended, and  I always enjoyed the shows. Charlee was cheeky but remarkably well informed. Children loved Charlee, and listened faithfully to his radio show Happy Talk on Saturday mornings.
  
Victor was more than an entertainer. He contributed to society in many ways. After his first wife died several years ago, he did good work to support the breast cancer cause.

He will be missed by many Singaporeans. - LHL

They are here for the Inter-Religious Relations in Plural Societies programme at S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies, NTU. 

We talked about maintaining harmony in a multi-racial and multi-religious society. Singapore has worked hard at this, as has Egypt. Just from my little time with them, I could see that Sheikh Dr Ali Gomaa and Archbishop Dr Mouneer are good friends, working closely together to promote peace and harmony between Muslims and Christians there.

We told old army stories and recalled those we served with, as tends to happen at such affairs. :) The evening ended with a toast to the Republic of Singapore, and Auld Lang Syne.  

We started the ROSC to train reservist (NSmen) officers to take on senior leadership roles in the SAF. Thanks to COL (NS) R Menon, the Commandant of the Singapore Command and Staff College, and his team of directing staff, the ROSC was a resounding success. 

Today the ROSC has become the Command and Staff Course (NS), and the staff college has been named after Dr Goh Keng Swee. But what hasn’t changed is the capability and resolve of our NSmen, and our commitment to them. 

MINDEF recently announced the recommendations of the Committee to Strengthen National Service, including the revamped NS HOME Awards, which will support our NSmen in housing, healthcare and education, and accident insurance.

It is not the last word on the matter. But it reflects how societies are still finding the right balance between freedom of speech and responsible online behaviour.

When governing a country, we are seldom lucky enough to have simple problems to solve. Usually the problem is complex, and has no perfect solution. Then we need to compromise and accept trade-offs. 

Take the CPF for example. As Tan Chuan-Jin told MPs yesterday, the CPF has served many of our housing, medical and retirement needs. But people are living longer, and their retirement needs will grow. How can CPF provide adequately for them? Who will bear the costs? We have been thinking about this for some time, together with the Pioneer Generation Package. By the National Day Rally, I should be ready to share more. 
 
Thanks to all of you who have written on this page to express your support (e.g., Suhana Ismail, Chun Zheng), especially those who wrote on the vital question of keeping politics constructive.

We must also remain an open and mobile community, so every citizen has the opportunity to do well whatever their family backgrounds.

People are using English words in spoken and written Chinese directly, without translating them into Chinese equivalents, or even transliterating them into similar sounding Chinese characters.  It is easier to say GDP than 国内生产总值, and Wifi is Wifi. 

This is causing controversy in China. Some think it is the practical thing to do – everybody knows what Wifi is, so why invent some unfamiliar Chinese term for the same thing? But others feel that the pure Chinese language is being polluted with foreign words. After all, some translations have been successful – Coca Cola 可口可乐 has a very appropriate meaning, and translating email into 电邮 is neat and succinct.

The same thing is happening to other languages too. If you listen to Malay spoken in Malaysia, or Tamil in India, you will often hear English words mixed in.

The reality is that a language is a live, changing thing. It constantly absorbs words, concepts and usages from foreign languages, so long as people are using it in their daily lives. Otherwise it becomes a dead language, studied by scholars but not spoken by ordinary people anymore, like Latin or Sanskrit.

We pay a lot of attention to languages in Singapore. We are doing our utmost to keep our mother tongues alive. These are live languages to be used, so we should accept that they will evolve and change over time. We need to speak and write them correctly, but also colloquially.

Benny had a troubled youth. But he made good, and started Eighteen Chefs, a chain of restaurants. Now he trains and hires ex-convicts as well as youths with troubled pasts, giving them a second chance. 

Benny tapped on NTUC’s Employment and Employability Institute (e2i)’s Inclusive Growth Programme (IGP) to improve productivity in his restaurants. Then he passed on the productivity gains to workers in higher wages.

Benny tells his own story in this interview:

They did have concerns, especially for two groups: older workers, and low-wage workers. They knew what the govt is doing to help. They naturally would like us to do more.

Dixie and I were from the same batch of MPs. We entered Parliament together in 1984. For many years before that, all the MPs had been male. Dixie, along with Dr Aline Wong and Mdm Yu-Foo Yee Shoon, were the only female MPs elected that year. They more than held their own, and stood out in the House.
 
Dixie was a hardworking MP who cared for her residents and spoke up for them in Parliament. She retired in 1991 to pursue a second career as a family and marriage therapist. She told me she derived great satisfaction from this. It was in keeping with her temperament and concern for others.
 
She was also an active volunteer. She founded the Association for Educationally Subnormal Children (later renamed the Association for Persons with Special Needs), and was Adviser to the Singapore Bank Employees’ Union. She received the Public Service Star for her community contributions, before she became an MP.
 
Dixie impressed with her quiet self-confidence, good sense, and gentle resolve. She spoke softly, but pressed with conviction for what she believed in. Although her sons had special needs, and needed her love and care, she was able to fulfil her public as well as family roles amply.
 
May Dixie rest in peace.

Guangdong has transformed itself in the last 20 years. They talk about 腾笼换鸟 – clearing the cage and changing the bird, meaning changing from old industries to new ones; and 凤凰涅磐 – being reborn like the Phoenix from the ashes, meaning reinventing and upgrading the economy. Singapore is travelling on this path too. So I had a very good discussion with Hu, sharing our experiences and exchanging notes. 

Singapore enjoys extensive cooperation with Guangdong province. The Sino-Singapore Guangzhou Knowledge City project is progressing well. A large part of our trade and investment with China is actually with Guangdong.

新加坡和广东省有密切的合作关系，中国与新加坡的重点合作项目中新广州知识城,进展顺利。新加坡在中国的贸易还有投资，有相当大的部分是在广东省。我今年九月将有机会再走访广东。上一次到广东是2006年，我很期待看到新的广东。

The students had interesting perspectives on this Budget and shared ideas on what they would like to see next year.

I explained to them that the purpose of the Budget is to decide on where and how the Government is going to raise and spend its money for the year. 

This year, we had two main goals:

First, we want to grow our economy, to create more and better jobs for Singaporeans, and to give citizens more opportunities to upgrade themselves and improve their lives.

Second, we are building a fair and equitable society. The Budget contains schemes to help people afford medical treatment, public transport, education, housing, etc. It also recognises our Pioneer Generation through a special healthcare package (http://www.singaporebudget.gov.sg/budget_2014/pgp.aspx).

Last night I attended the Legal Service Dinner. These officers support our ministries, staff the Attorney General’s Chambers, and run the courts. Their work has become heavier and more complex over time. We now have nearly 600 Legal Officers.

My thanks to all MPs for their active participation, and to ministers for working hard to listen, reassure, and explain. I am heartened by the general support for Budget 2014. 
 
Yesterday and today, Gan Kim Yong and Chan Chun Sing explained how we are strengthening social safety nets so that no one gets left behind. One key initiative is MediShield Life, which will cover every Singaporean, throughout his or her life.

Premiums for MediShield Life will be affordable for all, especially the elderly and the low-income. 
 
The Govt will bear most of the initial costs of universal coverage under MediShield Life. We will also introduce permanent subsidies for lower- to middle-income groups. For those who despite this help can’t afford their remaining share of premiums, Medifund will provide additional assistance. 
 
After all the subsidies, most households should be able to pay their MediShield premiums using just half of their Medisave contributions. 

Lower- to middle-income households should pay either the same or less premiums for MediShield Life as they are paying for MediShield today. 

The Pioneer Generation will be fine too. Effectively, those aged 80 and above today will have their premiums fully covered. Younger Pioneers (aged 65 – 79) on MediShield today will pay half of current premiums, but get better coverage. 
 
MediShield Life depends on everyone chipping in to share the burden, to take collective responsibility to protect one another. While MediShield Life gives us peace of mind for our health costs, let’s all do our part to stay healthy and avoid getting sick. This is the best way to keep health costs low, live long and live well.

MND had fewer cuts (items raised by MPs for discussion) this year than previous years, which hopefully shows that people are less worried about housing!

Lui Tuck Yew described what we are doing to reduce train disruptions, and cut waiting and travel time. We have bought more trains and will put more buses on the road, so as to service commuters better, especially during peak periods. 

Lawrence Wong announced plans to build more sports facilities all over the island, so that most Singaporeans will have sports facilities a short walk from home. The National Museum will have a new Wing, Play@NMS, dedicated to children and young families. We hope young Singaporeans will visit the Museum often, and grow up with fond memories of the Museum.

But we must not lose sight of what is happening in the outside world, and how faraway events can affect us. Take for example the crisis in Ukraine, which Minister K Shanmugam Sc talked about in his speech yesterday (http://bit.ly/1e1SDg7). 

Ukraine is bigger than Singapore, but much smaller than its neighbour, Russia. For the last few months, the country has been in turmoil. Two weeks ago, President Yanukovich fled, and his pro-Russian government collapsed. Russian troops then intervened in the Crimea, a part of Ukraine that used to belong to Russia, and where Russia still has a naval base. 

If war breaks out in Ukraine, the global economy will be affected, and so will ours. We condemn any unprovoked invasion of a sovereign country, whatever the pretext. All countries, big and small, must observe international law. This is vital to a small country like Singapore. 

Russia is a nuclear power. Ukraine signed a treaty in 1994 with Russia, the US and UK to give up its nuclear weapons, in exchange for which the US and Russia agreed not to use force against Ukraine. Yet Ukraine is in this predicament today. 

The Ukraine crisis reminds us that small countries must defend themselves, and cannot rely solely on international treaties or the promises of others. That is why we must always maintain a strong SAF and Home Team. We must also have a capable MFA to strengthen our ties with friends and allies. Only then can Singapore be safe and secure.

1439,2014-01-25 12:00:00,"The issue of wearing the tudung (headscarf in Malay) by Muslim women is an important matter for many Muslims in Singapore. This evening I met community and religious leaders, together with some Ministers and MPs, for a candid and fruitful dialogue. Snapped this pic of the participants at the end – all in good spirits! 

I told the group that I fully appreciate their desire to allow Muslim women in uniform to wear the tudung. But a larger issue is at stake: the sort of society we aspire to be. Singapore is a multi-racial, multi-religious and harmonious society. Minorities are fully integrated into the mainstream, but have full opportunities to maintain their identities and practise their faiths. So I am also mindful how crucial it is for us to strengthen our cohesion, and maintain the relaxed confidence and trust that benefits us all, especially the minorities.

On the tudung issue, the position is not frozen. Attitudes will shift and arrangements will get updated. We have gradually evolved over the last decade. Many statutory boards now have uniforms that allow Muslim staff to wear the tudung, e.g., LTA, NEA. In 5, 10 years’ time, I am confident that we will not be in the same situation as today.

It is best that we continue evolving gradually and carefully. The racial harmony we enjoy is not perfect, but it is more precious and more fragile than we think. Let’s work hard to strengthen it, so that all races can live happily together as one united people. – LHL

Isu tudung adalah isu penting bagi ramai orang Islam di Singapura. Petang tadi saya dan beberapa Menteri serta Anggota Parlimen telah bertemu dengan wakil-wakil masyarakat dan pemimpin agama. Perbincangan kami berlangsung secara terus terang, dan dari hati ke hati. Lihat gambar para peserta yang saya petik di akhir sesi – semuanya dalam semangat muhibbah! 

Saya tekankan kepada para peserta bahawa saya akur hasrat mereka untuk membenarkan wanita Islam di sektor seragam memakai tudung. Tetapi isu lebih besar harus difikirkan: Apakah bentuk masyarakat yang kita inginkan? 

Singapura adalah sebuah masyarakat berbilang bangsa dan agama yang harmoni. Kaum minoriti sebati dengan masyarakat lebih besar tetapi memiliki peluang sepenuhnya untuk kekalkan identiti dan amalkan agama masing-masing. Jadi saya sedar betapa gentingnya untuk memperkukuh ikatan kita bersama dan mengekalkan keyakinan dan kepercayaan yang mendatangkan manfaat untuk kita semua, lebih-lebih lagi kaum minoriti.

Dalam isu tudung, keadaan yang kita lihat hari ini tidak akan kekal begini. Sikap akan berubah dan dikemaskinikan. Sepanjang sedekad lalu, ada kemajuan yang bertahap dalam isu ini. Kini, banyak badan berkanun membenarkan kakitangan mereka memakai tudung bersama pakaian seragam misalnya LTA, NEA. Dalam 5, 10 tahun lagi, saya yakin keadaan akan berubah, tidak seperti hari ini. 

Sebaiknya kita terus bergerak secara bertahap dan berhati-hati. Sesungguhnya keharmonian kaum yang kita nikmati tidak sempurna, ia sebenarnya lebih rapuh dan berharga dari apa yang kita sedari. 

Ayuh kita berusaha gigih untuk memperkukuhkannya supaya semua kaum boleh hidup bersama-sama dengan selesa sebagai satu warga yang bersatu-padu. - LHL",362,488,4802,0,0,0,0,0
