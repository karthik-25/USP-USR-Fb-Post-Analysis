--------------------------------------------------------
On 19 December 2016, a truck ploughed into crowds at a Berlin Christmas market, killing 12 and injuring over 50. The body of the original driver was found in the passenger seat, stabbed and shot in the head. ISIS claimed responsibility for the attack.
 
People celebrate Christmas, festive spirit in the air, everyone is happy and social. And a man, who is in the country out of the goodwill of Germans, decides he wants to kill those who are celebrating.
 
The man was identified to be 24 year old Tunisian Anis Amri.
 
German authorities later revealed that Amri had been on their radar for months.
 
Amri was arrested for several crimes, including arson, in Sicily and served a 4 year prison sentence between 2011-2014.
 
Amri arrived in Germany in July 2015. Within months, German authorities classified him as a “Gefahrder” – a radical Islamist who was thought to have the potential to carry out a terror attack. He was placed under close observation by German security services.
 
During this time, Amri visited radical mosques, mingled with extremist preachers and was linked to extremist networks. He was known to have offered himself to be a suicide bomber. He allegedly planned to steal money to purchase weapons. He was known by the Police to have used different aliases and nationalities.
 
However, under German laws, the authorities could not pre-emptively arrest him or produce him in court. Unable to find sufficient evidence, the monitoring stopped in September 2016 – 3 months before the attack. The state Police chief said that they had “exhausted all legal powers to the limit to ward off potential dangers.”
 
After the attack, Amri was able to travel to Milan, until he was killed 4 days later in a shoot-out with Police
 
We understand the situation the authorities in Germany found themselves in – they had reason to be worried about the man, but could not do anything.

Our laws are different. Someone like Amri would have been arrested under the ISA (if he was assessed to be a radical who might potentially carry out an attack), and kept away from engaging in terrorism, killing people.
 
If someone engages in any conduct that is potentially a trigger for terrorism, and we know about it – that person will be on our radar, and may be detained, depending on the circumstances. Or, depending on assessment, that person may be counselled, and  may be placed on a Restriction Order (RO), whereby he will keep to some conditions.
 
For example, in Aug 2016, we took action against 5 Singaporeans who came into contact with radical materials online and on the radio, and had favourable views towards ISIS. 2 were detained and 3 were placed on ROs. One of the detainees, coincidentally, was a waste truck driver.
 
In Amri’s case, under German law the authorities could not move unless they had concrete evidence of an imminent threat; or an actual incident had taken place.  
 
We adopt a policy of zero tolerance, and intervene early. Large majority of Singaporeans understand the need for, and support our laws on preventive detention.

____________________

Some recent news on murders in Chicago.

In 2016, 762 people were reported to be murdered. There were  4,331 shooting victims from about 3,550 incidents. This is just one city. Victims included two teenagers, aged 18 and 21. Recently, even a 15 year old boy was shot dead.

The violence is both saddening and deplorable.  

The lack of safety and security has also lasting negative impact on the young.  There is some suggestion that many kids in Chicago’s most violent areas live in ‘survival mode’. They may be unable to identify and respond appropriately to cues related to safety and danger because of the tense environment they grew up in.

Americans would have to find their own ways to resolve the issue of gun ownership and violence.

Some lessons for us.

We remain one of the top cities for safety and security in various international polls. We are tough on crime. And we have tough laws on guns, murders.

We also have one of the leanest police forces in the world. Our police force is professional, not corrupt, and respected by our people.

All in all, a good position for us to be in, compared with many other cities.

In May, she and her partner responded to a taxi driver who reported about his hostile passengers.

Lim’s abusive conduct was terrible on several levels. He attacked a lady. He attacked an officer in uniform, doing her duty.
 
He has been sentenced to 10 weeks jail for this. I have asked the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) to relook at the legislation, to consider whether this is adequate. I have said to MHA that anyone who attacks a uniformed officer should learn a lesson, which he will never forget; and it should be enough of a deterrence to others.

A 39 year-old man had held a 2 yr old boy hostage for 17 hours. In a flat in Sembawang Drive.
 
After talking to him for a long time, officers from Special Ops Command (SOC), with help of SCDF, stormed the flat, in a matter of seconds and freed the boy.
 
The Police video below shows a little bit of how this was done. Meanwhile officers also rappelled down the block, waiting, just outside the window of the flat, to rescue the boy, in case the man threw the boy out of the window.
 
The man has been arrested for among other things, taking the boy hostage, and for drug offences. The boy’s mother has also been arrested for drug related offences.
 
Our Officers did very well, engaging the man, assessing, because the life of the boy was at risk. And finally they moved in at the right time, and did it very quickly and well.
 
Thank them for their professionalism.

The only reason we don’t have more such incidents is because of our tough policy on drugs.

Would you be able to help your family, someone else? 

Would you be able to give details to the Police, using the new App? 

Would you be able to help mobilise the community to respond?

-------------------- 
Mr SR Nathan has passed away, aged 92.
 
An extraordinary life. 50 years in public service. Totally dedicated to Singapore.

A unionist, top civil servant, Ambassador to Malaysia and the US, community worker. President. 

And a man who has lived life to its fullest.

Despite growing up in harsh and difficult times, Mr Nathan persevered and worked his way up. His life revolved around helping others. He started out as a medical social worker before joining the union and was a key figure in creating NTUC.

During his time in Ministry of Defence (Singapore), he risked his life in the Laju hijacking incident, in exchange for the safe release of Singaporean hostages. As Ambassador to the USA under MFA, he dealt with the Michael Fay incident, firmly and diplomatically defending our point of view. His charm and toughness showed the world that we were no pushovers.

Mr Nathan served as President for 12 years with grace, dignity and compassion. He established the President's Challenge to help the less fortunate. During the Global Financial Crisis, he approved the request to draw on our reserves after being advised and briefed by the Council of Presidential Advisors. We emerged unscathed from the crisis.
 
Even after stepping down, Mr Nathan continued to work. He often attended events and fund-raisers to help the needy, which he deeply cared for. He wrote and published several books, sharing his wisdom accumulated over decades of experience.
 
In May this year, a group of friends, formerly colleagues and ordinary Singaporeans presented him a book titled “With Gratitude”.  It captures their stories of how Mr Nathan’s kindness touched their lives. 
 
For Mr Nathan, it was always Singapore, before self.

Many will join me in extending our deepest condolences to his family.

----------------------------------------------------------
Media reports show that lawyer Edmund Wong was severely told off by the Judge.  He had said, to a female victim, that it was her clothes and size of breasts that led to her being molested!  His case theory was that only attractive women get molested.  Novel argument. They don’t (as far as I know) teach that in law school.  I wonder what Edmund’s response will be if he was told all men who say this should be castrated.
 
Women, who are victims of sexual assault, are seen as fair game in court for cross-examination. Their past, sexual history etc. are looked into, to make the suggestion of looseness and therefore consent. 

A few weeks ago, I had posted on the travails of the victim in the Stanford rape case involving Brock Turner. The hearing put the victim through unacceptable examination. This happens in many places in the world, with court processes which, in my view, are not sufficiently sensitive to what victims have gone through. The counter argument that there could be a frame up, and therefore the allegations should be thoroughly examined, is also true. But there must be a better way to do this.
 
Earlier this year, I had asked my officials to look into the current legal process, to consider changes in the way the investigations and trials are conducted, when women are the alleged victims. And I have asked them to also consult with NGOs, others , including organisations seeking to protect women’s interests.

This shows how our enemies are thinking of different ways of attacking us.
 
I have on several occasions referred to Molenbeek – the Belgian town from which the Paris attacks were planned. And have pointed out that there are several possible Molenbeeks around us, from which attacks can be launched on Singapore. These include the Riau islands. Terrorists who will seek to come in through our checkpoints; they will also try to launch attacks from just outside. And this is in addition to lone wolf attacks from radicalised individuals/groups.

-------------------------------------------------------------
There has been troubling news of riots in Indonesia, last Friday evening (in Tanjung Balai, North Sumatra). Fortunately, Indonesian police managed to bring the situation under control overnight.

At least six Chinese temples were reportedly burnt during the riots.

Reports suggest that the incident was sparked by an insensitive remark by a Chinese lady. She was apparently upset by the loud call to prayer from a mosque in front of her house. She went to the mosque to confront the Imam.

Her argument with the Imam was reported on social media. News soon spread, tensions escalated and the situation very quickly deteriorated into mass looting and damage of property. Hundreds of people were allegedly involved. Several Chinese pagodas and monasteries were set on fire.

Local police managed to stop groups from burning down the woman’s house but could not prevent the temples from being attacked. The Indonesian police has blamed social media for inciting the violence with false, provocative news that riled people.

We see time and again how an insensitive remark, argument can quickly spark a major riot or conflict. And news, as well as rumours can easily spread, and the consequences can be clashes along ethnic, religious lines.

Attached are some media reports on the incident.

---------------------------------------------------
The latest monthly progress report on Aljunied-Hougang Town Council (AHTC) issued by KPMG paints a devastating account of the Workers’ Party’s mis-management of its town council. It is a damning litany of highly irregular and suspicious financial practices, poor governance structures and extensive leadership failures. 
 
KPMG, AHTC’s own independent accountants, has uncovered even more faults than the Auditor-General’s Office (AGO) and AHTC’s statutory auditors. AGO and AHTC’s statutory auditors found 115 failures. KPMG uncovered another 70 – making a total of 185 failures. Since the AGO audit, the situation has not gotten better. It has gotten far worse.
 
KPMG says:
•       AHTC’s “control failures,” were “pervasive, cutting across the key areas of governance, financial control, financial reporting, procurement and records management over the course of five years.”
•       There was no “culture of compliance to controls”. 
•       “There was no ….…enforcement of integrity and ethical values,” 
 
KPMG’s Report underlines the key issue: AHTC’s leadership has neither upheld nor enforced integrity and ethical values. The rot is at the top. This should come as no surprise. The High Court and the Court of Appeal have already criticised Ms Sylvia Lim and Mr Pritam Singh for suppressing the truth (designed to mislead) both in Parliament and in Court. To them, the truth is a tradable commodity. I will say more about this in another post.
 
KPMG also found that AHTC’s lapses were not isolated, but rather “pervasive” and “systemic”: “There is an issue larger than the sum of individual lapses at AHTC”, it says, “a failure in the control environment”, which “includes the governance and management functions and the attitudes, awareness and actions of those charged with governance and management”.
 
KPMG said that AHTC used highly irregular shortcuts to process millions of dollars in payments to related parties, and “suppliers”. It used “dummy” vendor codes for payments, without specifying who the suppliers were. These practices could have concealed duplicate or fraudulent payments. Obviously, WP’s leadership thought they could play Aljunied residents – and Singaporeans -- for dummies.
 
Despite auditors flagging concerns over four years – including the AGO itself – AHTC’s Finance & Investment Committee and Audit Committee were not bothered. They didn’t even meet regularly to deal with the issues.
 
The attitude of AHTC in dealing with its severe problems is quite telling. In response to KPMG’s report, Mr Pritam Singh breezily says: “AHTC accepts all the recommendations in full”.
 
That’s it. He seems to think that suffices. No need for apologies, explanations, clarifications.
 
He does not explain why AHTC indulged in “highly irregular” practices. He does not explain why there was “failure in (its) control environment”. He doesn’t apologise for the mess, nor account for the “attitudes, awareness and actions of those charged with governance and management” – i.e., AHTC’s political leadership, WP’s six MPs. Is he himself (having already misled the Court of Appeal) in a position to enforce ethical values?
 
Mr Singh’s attitude is consistent with what KPMG in essence said about them: That AHTC’s management has not acted responsibly in dealing with its failings. Where is their sense of responsibility to put things right? Where is their sense of duty, honour and integrity?
 
They went to court to oppose, tooth and nail, the appointment of an independent accountant. We know now why: They don’t want any light shone into their dark corners, of which there are many. This is another subject I will deal with in another post.
 
Mr Singh and his colleagues can’t keep Singaporeans in the dark so easily.
 
•       Many of the problems KPMG identified deal with payments -- running into millions of dollars -- which have already been made. What is Mr Singh and his colleagues going to do about them?
•       Who received the payments and for what purpose? How many of them were genuine? Who amongst your friends benefitted? Why did you use dummy codes for payments – i.e. who really received the payments?
•       For four years, your auditors have been asking for supporting documents. Are you finally going to produce them, or admit that they do not exist?
 
We are still at the early stages in this painful saga. So far KPMG has only looked at the control environment and accounting systems and so on. The Court of Appeal had also directed that the accountants to look into the actual payments that AHTC has made over the years, identify their lawfulness, and where necessary, take steps to recover the payments.
 
Much work remains to be done. More facts will emerge, facts which will show what actually happened to the monies, and what the WP has been up to in Aljunied, Hougang, and for two years Punggol East.",155,300,428,77,6,3,8,25

92% of respondents to a public perception survey in 2015 agreed that Singapore has a fair and efficient legal system. They have trust and confidence in the system.
 
Over the last 25 years, our crime rate has come down, from 1,500 crimes for every 100,000 people, to 600 in 2015.

But from time to time, our officers also get verbally abused, with unfair, sarcastic or offensive remarks.
 
Recently a resident wrote to me complaining about rats. Even as the staff from the People’s Association, Town Council and Residents’ Committee tried to help, he continued to write emails peppered with sarcasm to mock them. He seemed to think that he had a right to do so.
 
After mocking them, he then wrote to me in these terms:
 
“Thank you for making wonderful visit (sic) almost every week at Chong Pang Blk 107. Maybe you have been too busy meeting the residents and grassroot members are also blinded by the job to served (sic) as much every week on non essential matters. I would like to share a little secret with you…you have a new family in our neighbourhood and maybe you and your grassroot team would like to meet them personally. I have uploaded a video to introduce themselves to you and maybe you could drop by when you are around next week.’’ He then uploaded a video of some rats. He was being sarcastic, even while acknowledging my regular presence.
 
We responded. I told him that the Town Council was dealing with the problem.
 
I then told the Town Council staff to see him, and explain to him what steps were being taken.
 
He responded as follows:
 
“If your team is so confidence (sic) that it would be able to resolve 90% of the problem I had hightlighted (sic), please join me at 730 am at blk … at lift lobby D.’’
 
The officers contacted him and made an appointment for a Sunday morning at 7.30am. Three Town Council representatives, one RC chairman and one PA staff waited for him.
 
The resident switched off his mobile phone and didn’t turn up without any notice!
 
He deliberately wasted the time of the officers, and the RC volunteer.
 
When he was sent an email setting out his conduct he responded sarcastically – that he will give a further response. But nothing has been heard from him since then.

113,2016-07-19 20:45:00,"Drugs destroy Lives – Reflections from a visit to a welfare home
--------------------------------------------------------
 
Some weeks ago, I visited a Home which provides shelter and care for boys who are neglected, abused or homeless, juvenile offenders and those beyond parental control.
 
The boys in the Home, are aged between 10 and 18. There were nearly 70 of them. The majority (about 70%) come from either single parent families (parents either divorced or widowed) or reconstituted families (I.e. they have step-parents and step-siblings).
 
What struck me was that, 30 of the boys (about 45%) come from families where one or both parents were involved in drug abuse. As their parents were embroiled with drugs, many of the boys end up in the care of their elderly grandparents or relatives, or in foster care. The Home took them in when these alternative care arrangements were no longer viable.
 
Sadly, many of these boys do not see much of their parents throughout their growing up years. Some of their parents suffered from serious health issues arising from long-term drug abuse (e.g. cancer, depression), leading to prolonged absence, or even death.
 
“A’’ is one such example. ""A"" never met his dad. His mum could not take care of him due to drug-related offences. He was first placed in foster care when he was 3 years old. He and his mum were only reunited momentarily each time his mum came out of rehab. By 9 years old, ""A"" had been to several different foster families. However, it was difficult for the foster families to continue to care for him.
 
When ""A"" first came to the Home at age 13, he suffered from anger issues and feelings of rejection. Over time and through the Home’s support, he became much calmer and his emotions stabilised. His studies improved. He developed a passion for gardening and art, and spends time tending to the garden in the Home.
 
""A"" always dreamt of the day that he could be with his mum again. However, his hopes were crushed when he received the sad news that his mum had died of cancer. He is now 16 years old. The Home has been the only ‘family’ for him.
 
The boys’ stories remind us how drugs not only destroy the lives of abusers, but affects their loved ones and future generations of Singaporeans.

BBC News reports that there were, in the US:
- 150 mass shootings in 2016 [6 months!]
- 6381 deaths through gun shots in 2016
- 357 million firearms [estimated]
- 101 firearms for every 100 people [estimated]

It is quite tragic that the country is not able to find a way to control guns from reaching madmen, criminals, terrorists and would be mass murderers.

The Wall Street Journal said in a recent article:

“There is no reason why the American public should be able to purchase military-style semiautomatic weapons such as the AR-15, which has become a favorite of mass shooters. 

As retired Gen. Stanley McChrystal, one of the leaders of a new veterans' group for gun control, notes, the purpose of the AR-15 is to kill a great many people as quickly as possible. It is also important to ban high-capacity magazines, which allow a killer to keep killing without reloading. 

Mateen used a Sig Sauer MCX semiautomatic rifle (similar to the AR-15) with a 30-round magazine.

Even if bans on assault weapons and high capacity magazines aren't politically possible, Congress should, at a minimum, prevent suspects on terrorism watch lists from purchasing firearms legally -- something that they were able to do 223 times in 2015, according to the Government Accountability Office.""

So even suspects on terrorism watch lists can buy firearms!

Some Congressmen decided to do a sit-in protest in Congress, because they were unable to get gun controls passed into law. Video is below.

Scenes like this makes one wonder – Is America able to provide its people with real safety and security?

129,2016-06-23 13:58:00,"Stanford Rapist Brock Turner

Many would have read about the rapist, Brock Turner who got off quite lightly. 

His victim detailed the travails she had to go through. From the sexual assault by her perpetrator to the invasive examination she was put through to collect evidence and the interrogation in court.

The potential maximum punishment for Brock Turner was 14 years in a state prison. He was eventually sentenced to 6 months in a county jail and probation!

The 6-month sentence borders on the absurd.  Cases like this can diminish confidence in the system as a whole.

Any effective criminal justice system must achieve 3 things:
· It must not make it difficult for women to report the crimes.

· It must not put women through unnecessary ordeal during investigations and interrogation in court and should be sensitive to the state of the victims.  

· And when guilt is proven, the punishment for such serious crimes must be commensurate with the gravity of the crime.

I read the young woman’s account of what she had to go through in Court, being subjected to a highly offensive line of questions.  It suggested a complete lack of remorse by Brock Turner.  And his father’s statement, that it was only “20 minutes of action” was something else altogether.

In Singapore, we need to take a strict approach to these sorts of offences.  And we need to work at making it easier for women to report and undergo examination when they have been victims of sexual violence.

This evening,  I joined the Iftar at Khadijah Mosque.

I was asked by the media about the Orlando shooting incident. I said: The motives of the gunman are not yet clear. Investigations are continuing. But it looks like the gay community has been targeted. This is unacceptable. Violence against any group and any form is not acceptable. Here, the Government will act decisively, if there is threat or violence against anyone or any group.

The Government's duty is to protect everyone. Their race, their religion, their sexual orientation - these are not relevant in terms of the Government’s duty to protect. We have a duty to protect everyone. And I think in this incident, (it) again highlights the threat of terror, whether it's targeted at religious groups or whether it's targeted at specific people, individuals. And we, as Singaporeans, have to come together, unite together to fight this terror.

They started a public piano initiative called Play it Forward Singapore. They want to donate a piano to the Home for the boys.

------------ 
I visited the Muhammadiyah Welfare Home Carnival last Saturday. The Home provides shelter for boys who need some help. I had a  chat with the boys.
 
The boys care a lot about their future – they need the right support. I was impressed by the focus shown by some of the boys, on what they wanted to achieve.
 
An unforgettable experience was when two of the boys performed on the piano for us.
 
The two teenagers – Sha and Remy – were never taught music. They don’t read notes.
 
The piano had been donated to the Home. None of the teachers in the Home could play the piano. They kept the piano in a room .
 
One day, the staff heard beautiful piano music. They went to the room and saw one of the boys playing the piano. They found out that two of them could play the piano – Sha and Remy. They were asked who taught them. The boys said no one taught them, they just “listened to the music many times and ‘tangkap’ (i.e. catch the tune)”. Both boys discovered their hidden talent and passion from the piano.
 
When I visited last week, the two boys confidently played classical and pop pieces for us. They must obviously be musically inclined .
 
Both of them came to the Home because they did not have a stable home environment and there were concerns about their safety and protection. Their performance shows what can be achieved with perseverence, interest.

At the SCDF Workplan Seminar recently, I met 4 people who are true heroes, while leading normal lives:

• Ms Michelle Lim saved a life. She is a resident in Bishan. She had volunteered to be trained in first aid, and use of AED for resuscitation. She was alerted by the SCDF myResponder app, on 3 January 2016 to a cardiac arrest case. She was having breakfast at her neighbourhood coffeeshop in her flat at that time. She rushed to the scene and performed CPR on the casualty until SCDF paramedics arrived.

• Mr Nay Zar Kyaw Min was driving when he saw an elderly Chinese lady lying in a pool of blood by the roadside. Mr Nay, who was trained under SCDF’s Community Emergency Preparedness Programme, immediately got out of his car to administer first-aid to the elderly lady while waiting for the arrival of SCDF paramedics. He also saved a life.

• Mr Mazlan, a taxi driver, was driving when he spotted a car on fire on the road. Together with another taxi driver, they used fire extinguishers from their taxis to put out the fire.

• Mr Simon Chan, a taxi driver, responded to a myResponder app alert. He rushed an AED in his taxi to the scene at Changi Airport Terminal 2 to aid the victim.

I asked Simon – what made him respond. He said he was in SCDF during his NS days, and wanted to help. Likewise the others – they said the same thing. A passion to learn what to do in an emergency, and a willingness to save lives.

They are true heroes, helping to look out for the safety of others.

Dr Chee has been trying to spread fear based on complete untruths (like - we have lost $800 billion!, we have created only 100 jobs!! etc.)

Surprising that he is not embarrassed to go out and say these things when they are obviously untrue.

Here is an article which appeared on Mothership which summarises the points made by DPM, and a video clip of his speech.

Today, Dr Chee Soon Juan, asked for his views on the ISA, said that this is an immigration issue, and not a security issue. 
 
SDP and he want the ISA scrapped.
 
He says that foreign workers should have been vetted before they came in, and that ICA has been lax. 
 
Dr Chee either does not understand the problem, or is playing politics.
 
Radicalisation is sweeping through the world. Hundreds have been arrested in Malaysia, including special forces, military officers and police officers. About a thousand have gone from Malaysia and Indonesia to fight with ISIS in the Middle East. We have also detained Singaporeans who had been radicalised.
 
As for immigration vetting of foreign workers – how would that pick up people who only become radicalised after they come here?  And even those who have some radical leanings before they come in – how would we know what is in their minds, unless they had gone public with those ideas?
 
We have tens of thousands of Bangladeshi workers in Singapore, doing tough jobs in the construction and marine industries, and in other areas, including our Town Councils. The vast majority are peaceful, here to work hard. We send them back – who will do their jobs ?
 
What is Dr Chee suggesting – that we ban all foreign workers ? Or that we ban all Muslim foreign workers ?

One student asked how we can ensure that Singapore continues to have good leaders in the future.
 
My reply was that we cannot rely on our laws to guarantee good leadership. Singapore was very fortunate that Mr #LeeKuanYew and his team of leaders had all the key ingredients for success – they were men of outstanding integrity, extremely competent, with vision. They worked for the best interests of Singaporeans. They did what was right instead of what was popular.
 
Whether Singapore continues to have good leaders will ultimately depend on our young people. Whether they will rise up to the challenge, and serve their fellow Singaporeans with integrity and excellence.

______________________________

Learnt with considerable sadness that Johan Cruyff has passed away. 

Cruyff and his Dutch teammates were peerless. They played amazing football. Cruyff was the Dutch captain in the first live game I watched - the 1974 World Cup Final between Holland  and West Germany. 

It was an exciting game, and is etched vividly in my memory. The Dutch scoring pretty much in the first minute. 

The Germans (as they almost always do) coming back to score two goals, one of which through Gerd Muller.

And then wave after wave of Dutch attacks in the second half - all stopped with the redoubtable Sepp Maier in form as goalkeeper. 

Johan Cruyff was a magician with the ball. He will live in the memories of many of us.

____________________________


Today, I outlined the way we will respond to terror. I made two major points:

First is that of our security response. We will increase our security forces and emergency response teams. They will have to deal with the evolving nature of threats. Their weapons will be upgraded and they will be trained to arrive quickly and take down the attackers. Their response has to be swift and effective.

Second point I made is that security will now have to be the concern of every Singaporean. It cannot be something to be dealt with just by our security forces. We will need the entire community to come together to deal with any attacks and the aftermath of an attack.

We will further develop all of that into a new national strategy – SGSecure.

This is a fight between freedom and terror.
A fight ultimately between good and evil.

---------- 
For several weeks many of us have been horrified by the appalling cruelty, in the mutilation and killing of many cats in Yishun.  Shocking, sickening. I encouraged my colleague, Louis Ng Kok Kwang to lead community efforts to deal with the situation, even as the police and the AVA were doing their best. I, like many others, was keen that the culprit(s) should be caught and the full weight of the law should be applied to them.
 
The investigations by the authorities zeroed in on a suspect. On Tuesday, 29 Dec 2015, one Mr Lee Wai Leong was charged in court. Many people were relieved that someone apparently responsible had been charged.
 
One of my volunteers subsequently told me that Mr Lee’s family broke down in court. They spoke to my volunteers, told him that they were unsure of the charges and the next steps. They also shared with my volunteers, Mr Lee’s medical condition. They said that he had the mentality of a kid, suffers from epilepsy fits and seizures that occur almost on a daily basis. He gives monosyllabic answers to questions. He does not work. He never went beyond P4, and was exempted from NS because of his medical condition. He gets treatment at KTPH.
 
The family lives in my constituency. Mr Lee’s father is the sole bread winner. The aged parents of Mr Lee are very worried and spoke with my volunteers, and pleaded for help. They said that they cannot afford to engage a lawyer and asked for help to get a lawyer.  
 
Some people heard about this and advised me that we should not help Mr Lee get a lawyer. They said that the public will misunderstand and think we are helping a cruel cat killer, and (by extension) that we support cruelty to animals. They are good, well-meaning people, who were genuinely concerned for me, and my volunteers.
 
I thought about this – in my mind, (based on what the parents have said) it was and is very clear that my duty is to help Mr Lee get a lawyer.  The court can then get all the facts and decide on the question of whether he is guilty, as well as the appropriate sentence, if (with emphasis), he is found guilty.
 
I believe that Singaporeans (including all those who were angry and appalled by the cruelty done to the cats) are at heart generous people, and will understand why we are helping to get a lawyer to act pro bono for Mr Lee. It is the right thing to do (with emphasis) in the circumstances. I don’t think people will therefore assume that I or the lawyer condone cruelty to animals. Far from it.

I have asked Josephus Tan, a lawyer who helps in my branch, if he will help Mr Lee. Josephus has agreed.
 
I would also suggest that pending the trial, we should refrain from coming to conclusions. We should leave matters to the court. The key thing is that the person(s) responsible for the killings should be identified and stopped; and should face the punishment according to the law. If someone is mentally unsound, then that is a matter to be proven in court, and for the court to consider in deciding on what to do.

MINISTER’S 2015 YEAR-END MESSAGE TO THE HOME TEAM

2015 will come to a close soon. I would like to convey my appreciation and commendation to all officers of the Home Team for your good work in keeping Singapore safe and secure. Your hard work and dedication to your mission have collectively kept Singapore one of the safest countries in the world. 

2. This year, Singapore’s Golden Jubilee, has been challenging and intense for the Home Team. You have contributed to the safety and security of the many national events throughout the year. These included the National Mourning for our founding Prime Minister Mr Lee Kuan Yew, the Southeast Asia Games, the Jubilee Weekend Celebrations and the General Election. Because of you, these events proceeded smoothly and Singaporeans were able to attend and participate in them safely. 

3. It has also been a busy year for the Home Team with the introduction of several new laws, namely, the Liquor Control (Supply & Consumption) Act, the Organised Crime Act and the Remote Gambling Act. These laws will strengthen our capabilities to maintain public order and suppress crime. 

4. Across the Home Team, new initiatives were introduced to ensure that we remained on top of an increasingly challenging environment. The introduction of the Integrated Checkpoints Command was a major shift in the way we operated at our checkpoints, bringing the various Home Team agencies under a single unified command for better operational efficiency and responsiveness. The Police achieved a milestone in its frontline policing strategy when it completed the implementation of the Community Policing System at all 35 Neighbourhood Police Centres this year.  

5. We have strengthened our community partnerships, by enabling the public to take greater ownership of safety and security outcomes. New initiatives implemented include the SCDF’s Save-A-Life initiative and MyResponder mobile app, the Police’s Vehicles-on-Watch project and the joint SCDF-Police Neighbourhood Active Responder (NEAR) Programme. In preventive education against drugs, following the recommendations of the Task Force on Youths and Drugs, an enhanced toolkit for teachers and youth counsellors was launched. On the rehabilitation front, our Yellow Ribbon Project has inspired similar movements in other countries, such as the US, Australia and the Philippines. 

6. The Home Team also participated actively in overseas operations, most notably during the Nepal and Sabah earthquakes and the haze crisis in Indonesia.  

7. Throughout a very challenging SG50 year, the Home Team has worked hard to deliver our mission, demonstrating strong operational excellence and preparedness. But we continue to face the threat of terrorism, especially from self-radicalised individuals. We also face international pressure against some of our policies, especially on drugs. Social norms are evolving and public expectations of the Home Team are increasing. Singapore’s changing demographics, with an ageing population and a local workforce that will stop growing in the near future, will impact on our operational resources.  We will need to rise up to these challenges.  

8. MHA has secured a multi-year resourcing arrangement from the Ministry of Finance, which will ensure that the Home Team is adequately resourced for the next few years. This certainty of resources allows us to make long term strategic plans. The Home Team has started on a transformational journey to plan ahead and develop new ways of doing our work in order to better tackle our challenges. We will enhance operational integration across the Home Team and systematically build up our capabilities. We will maximise the potential of our officers and leverage technology so that we can do more with less. And we will continue to enhance community partnerships so that the people of Singapore can contribute more to their own safety and security. 

9. I am privileged to have the opportunity to serve once more with the dedicated men and women of the Home Team. Thank you for your service and commitment to our mission, and your resolve in upholding our values of Honour and Unity. You are truly the Guardians of Singapore.

10. I wish all officers of the Home Team and your families the very best for the New Year ahead.

Some media reports had inaccurately given the impression that the re-arrest goes against the judgment delivered by the Court of Appeal. That is not so. 

If the Government feels that the judgment of a court, on a piece of legislation, does not accord with government's policy objectives, then the right approach is to go to Parliament to change the law. 

This is fundamental because the Judiciary and Civil Service are key institutions, and we need to respect and uphold their status. 
 
In this case, the court accepted that illegal match fixing could come within the CLTPA. The Court of Appeal however said that the Detention Order issued against Dan Tan did not comply with the requirements of the Act, and did not adequately set out the grounds which justified the detention.

STATEMENT BY MINISTER K SHANMUGAM, MINISTER FOR HOME AFFAIRS AND MINISTER FOR LAW, ON ATTACKS IN PARIS

Our deepest sympathies to the victims of the Paris attacks, and their families and loved ones. In this difficult time, our thoughts are with the French people. We pray for their recovery and that they will emerge stronger as a community.

These attacks show that no country is immune, even when there is a state of heightened security. In Singapore, today, we have raised our alert level. We have stepped up security measures, border checks and vigilance. 

Together, everyone plays a part to keep Singapore safe and secure. We encourage everyone to remain vigilant and report any suspicious activities or persons to the authorities. 

Such attacks aim to strike fear in the community. We must therefore continue to build up our social resilience. This will ensure that if an incident were to occur here, we will stand together, recover quickly and emerge stronger and more united.",73,360,1932,0,0,0,0,0

Mr Schmidt and Mr Lee had deep mutual admiration for each other. Both were sharp and tough. They were able to take pragmatic and strategic view of global developments. Mr Lee had once described the German leader as “a tough and intelligent leader able to identify the important issues in any given complicated situation’’. Mr Schmidt described Mr Lee’s last book as “the most valuable guidance for the 21st century world’s complexity’’.

---------- 
Mr Lee’s words above were quoted by former MFA Permanent Secretary Bilahari Kausikan, in a speech he made in Cambridge, recently.
 
Bilahari points out the harsh realities of our foreign policy and Singapore’s vulnerable position in the region. He paid tribute to our founding leaders Lee Kuan Yew, Goh Keng Swee and S Rajaratnam whose steady hands helped navigate us through some turbulent and dangerous times in the early years.

For small nations, in Bilahari’s words, foreign policy is usually about a series of “not always neat or consistent improvisations to a messy and unpredictable reality’’.
 
Diplomacy is not all about being pleasant or making oneself agreeable. It’s about defending and advancing Singapore’s interests, preferably by being pleasant and agreeable but if necessary “by any appropriate means’’.
 
Idealism is important. But all idealism must be rooted in a hard-headed understanding of human nature and power. “Without power nothing can be achieved. And even with power not everything desirable will always be feasible.’’ 
 
In his speech, Bilahari recalled how our founding PM once told a former chief of the Malaysian Armed Force that “if PAS comes into power…and tries to meddle with the water in Johor Bahru, I’ll move my troops in. I will not wait for the Security Council to solve this little problem’’.
 
Singapore has done well in the five decades since independence. As a nation, we cannot be ordinary if we want to be relevant to the world.
 
He concluded by reminding Singapore that our external environment remains complicated, unstable and dangerous.

--------------------
On 6 Oct 2015, a 4 year-old boy fell to his death in Yishun. He apparently fell from an open window in his flat. It was a tragic accident. It could have been prevented if there had been window grilles.

The family had just moved into the flat. The father of the child says that the contractor was supposed to do a number of works, including installing the window grilles.

The family’s move-in date had already been delayed for eight days by the contractor. When the family moved in, some of the agreed items had not been installed, including the window grilles.

Attempts to contact the contractor were not successful.

The father was particularly concerned about the window grilles as he had young children. He told the contractor this, and exchanged WhatsApp messages with the contractor. The contractor had removed the previous grilles but did not install new ones!.

According to the father, when he finally suggested to terminate the contract, the contractor asked to meet him, but did not turn up at the agreed date and time!

After a few days, the contractor contacted him to say that his company will send a cancellation letter. The letter never arrived.

The window grilles were not installed and the tragedy happened. 

The father attempted to contact the contractor, sent him the news reports of his son’s death – and no response from the contractor. No apology, no visit, and the father thinks the contractor has even blocked him, from messaging the contractor.

If these facts are true, then the conduct is shameful, irresponsible and has contributed to the tragedy.

One can understand the parents’ anger, anguish. To lose a child like this. Because someone has not done what he is supposed to have done. And the conduct after the tragedy is shocking.

When I visited the family, the parents were stoic. They recounted the story without rancour. I was quite upset.

There must be steps taken against such contractors – if what the father says is correct. We must help the family to get legal recourse. It wont bring back the child, but there has to be some justice done. I have told them we will help find a lawyer for the family.

Walked around Chong Pang this morning. The haze was in the unhealthy range, and there were much fewer people out on the streets than usual. I saw many wearing masks. As I walked around, the impact of the haze, on people, was obvious. I was coughing, eyes itching, the heat oppressive. Our senior citizens must be feeling much worse.

My Security Officer took some photos of the CTE, as I was driving. They show what the conditions were like this morning. And tonight, the haze reached hazardous levels.

A close friend told me her elderly parents are suffering a lot because of the haze. One of my grassroots leaders told me that his family had to stay indoors with all windows shut. Many other Singaporeans tell me similar things when I meet them, and they want the haze problem solved for good.

The Singapore government takes the matter seriously. We stand ready to assist Indonesia in combatting the fires. Last year, we introduced legislation to allow us to prosecute companies found to be causing or contributing to the haze. And we will not hesitate to take such actions against those errant companies.

The Indonesian government has said that it is taking steps to deal with the problem. We hope those steps will lead to lasting outcomes, and we are prepared with work with Indonesia on this.  

Yet at the same time, we are hearing some shocking statements made, at senior levels, from Indonesia, with a complete disregard for our people, and their own – PSI levels in parts of Indonesia are at almost 2,000 (PSI above 350 is considered hazardous in Indonesia).

I joined the Bone Marrow Donor Programme (Singapore) (BMDP) campaign on Saturday. It was held in conjunction with World Marrow Donor Day - WMDD.
 
Over 2000 people in Singapore are diagnosed with a blood disease every year. A bone marrow transplant can save them. The process does not require surgery . 
 
The procedure is simple. Signing-up is easy as well with just a two minutes cheek swab.
 
During the campaign, many people signed up with the donor register. This will help BMDP match more patients to potential donors.
 
However, the register needs more Malay, Indian and mixed ethnic donors, due to genetic similarities. This is important and beneficial for our Malay, Indian and mixed ethnic patients.

-----

Singaporeans are frustrated with the haze. Understandably so.

Year after year, the haze continues to recur.

The pollution affects not just the people of Singapore. The worst affected are the Indonesian people who are closest to the fires in Sumatra and Kalimantan.

It is a health hazard – especially to the young, the elderly, and those with chronic lung and heart conditions.

Regional economies are also affected. The 1997 haze cost Southeast Asia an estimated US$9 billion. The potential loss to Riau’s economy this year has been estimated at around 8% of the province’s GDP – some Rp20 trillion (around US$1.3 billion).

The frustration of our people is all the greater because the haze can be prevented. The majority of the fires are man-made, by companies seeking to profit while people pay the costs.

There is only so much that we can do here in Singapore to stop the fires as they are in another country. We have offered assistance to help fight the fires (including this year, but our offer has yet to be accepted). We passed a bill in August 2014 that would allow us to prosecute errant companies found to be causing or contributing to the haze. We have asked Indonesia to give us the names of the companies so that we can consider if we can take action against them.

Indonesia too has a responsibility to take legal and enforcement action against errant companies since these companies violate Indonesia’s own laws.

This year, the Indonesian government has declared a state of emergency and has deployed troops and assets to deal with the haze. Companies are reportedly being prosecuted. These are positive steps.

I spoke with Indonesian Foreign Minister Retno Marsudi on Friday and expressed our deep concern. A longer-term solution was necessary, and Singapore wanted to work with regional countries, including Indonesia, on this. We have over the years, raised the issue at ASEAN, the UN, and other fora. We have suggested ways in which regional countries can cooperate. There has however been no concrete progress. The international community is looking at how we deal with the problem. A lasting solution is needed. Our people expect that. And understandably so.",130,145,1949,0,0,0,0,0

I had not said anything like that.

I spoke about the issue of integration in the Malaysian education system. The key points I wanted to convey were:

1)       The Chinese leadership in various local areas in Malaysia want to maintain control over the Chinese population. It suits them to have Chinese students go to Chinese schools instead of mainstream Malaysian schools. And the schools are more Chinese (because they are effectively single race).

2)       At the same time, many mainstream schools in Malaysia are becoming more Malay (because the students are largely Malay) and Islamic (e.g. through the way some principals and teachers handle matters) which discourages the Chinese from going into those schools.

3)       So you end up with having more Malays going to mainstream schools, and more Chinese going to Chinese schools. As a result, the different races are kept apart from a young age.

4)       This makes integration more difficult.

My point therefore was essentially that this is the predominant situation in the Malaysian education system. This is not good for integration.

The video clip of the news carried the essence of what I said, and this is also evident from the transcript of what I said.

What Ms Thanapal wrote is inaccurate and seditious, and attributes to me sentiments that I do not hold and have never held.

- non-disclosure of related party transactions; and 
- reliability of their own accounts on S&CC collected and the amount owed to them after a few years.

-----------------------------------------
I was in Kuala Lumpur earlier this week for the 48th ASEAN Foreign Ministers’ Meeting and Related Meetings.
 
The Meetings were held in Putra World Trade Centre.  It is an UMNO building which has a long series of murals capturing parts of Malaysian history.
 
These murals are quite famous.  One of the murals depicts Mr Lee Kuan Yew and the Separation.
 
One of my officers said that in many ways, the mural captures some Malaysian perspective on Singapore.
 
The mural shows an angry Tunku pointing a finger, telling Mr Lee to go.  The Tunku is portrayed in heroic terms towering over Mr Lee.
 
My officer said that Mr Lee was portrayed almost like a devious person, slinking away with Singapore.
 
I was not so sure. Another perspective could be that it showed Mr Lee as being scared and worried as he walked away with Singapore, after being booted out.
 
Interesting to reflect on the different perspectives.  And interesting to speculate what our lives would be like if Singapore was still part of Malaysia today.
 
As we celebrate #SG50, I think most Singaporeans believe that Independence has been good for Singaporeans.

We remember Mr Lee and his steadfastness and commitment to Singapore.  Truly, we will not be here, without him and his exceptional team.  For us he is a true hero.

362,2015-07-30 22:36:04,"Some of you might have read about the death of #CecilTheLion in Zimbabwe.

Cecil was an iconic animal, majestic and much loved. Media reports say he was a ‘local favourite’ and famous in Zimbabwe. With his black fringed mane, he was a popular attraction in the National Park. He has been noticed and his movements have been followed since 2008.  He has been the subject of an Oxford study.

Cecil was killed in tragic circumstances by man, as blood sport. He was lured out of the National Park with a bait. An American dentist, shot him with a bow and arrow – for sport. Cecil was then left  to suffer for 40 hours before being gunned down. Cecil was then beheaded and skinned.

I don’t want to comment on whether the dentist did or did not believe that he had the necessary permits to do this hunting. 

My point is more basic. I find the circumstances of this killing quite unacceptable, barbarous. Cecil was lured out of his safe habitat. Baited out. Shot. Left to suffer. Then beheaded and skinned. And if one wants to truly engage in blood sport, then why use weapons, whether bow and arrow or guns? Does the animal have a chance? 

The dentist could perhaps have considered engaging in combat unarmed if he really felt that he wanted to test himself against a lion. That would be some test.

Poor Cecil.

_____________________
 
The past weeks have been painful for many of us. Ten Singaporean lives were lost on the slopes of Mount Kinabalu, 10 too many.
 
While we grieve, we salute the children, who displayed extraordinary courage and fortitude beyond their years in weathering this disaster, as well as the heroic acts of the teachers and mountain guides, some of whom sacrificed their lives to protect others.
 
Mr Mohamed Faizal and other teachers used their own bodies to shield students as boulders rained down. Despite sustaining injuries themselves, the teachers continued to put the safety and welfare of their students ahead of theirs. For Mr Terrence Loo and Mr Mohammad Ghazi, their last moments were defined by their selflessness and courage in attempting to save more students.
 
We also thank the Malaysian mountain guides who risked life and limb to guide climbers to safety during and after the earthquake. Their efforts prevented the fatality count from going higher. Sadly, Mr Valerian Joannes, Mr Robbi Sapinggi and other guides lost their lives in the line of duty.
           
As we unite as a nation to mourn, let us recall the heroism displayed. Their actions are a tribute to the departed, and an inspiration to us.

Spoke to the media earlier this week about the situation in Yemen. Singaporeans in Yemen should leave immediately, given the risks. With each passing day, our ability to rescue them is less. I made the following points.

-----

The situation in Yemen has worsened. MFA has issued three advisories so far, advising Singaporeans to leave.

Singapore has worked with many other countries - China, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Oman and the Philippines - to get over 20 of our citizens out of Yemen.

Last Saturday, MFA deployed a Crisis Response Team in Oman. With the assistance of the Omani government and others, we got another eight citizens out.

These operations are complex, and we don’t have an Embassy on the ground.

Despite the obvious risks, there are still over 40 of our citizens in Yemen. MFA is contacting their next-of-kin to persuade them to advise their loved ones to try and leave.

The government has a duty to try and help our citizens in situations like this. At the same time, people have an individual personal responsibility not to put themselves at risk. The longer they continue to be there, the more they are putting themselves at risk, and the more difficult it becomes for any sort of rescue operations to be conducted.

We can draw some lessons from the situation in Syria – despite many MFA advisories, some of our people did not leave Syria in time. They eventually found all their escape routes cut off, making exit extremely difficult.

Many foreign Embassies in Yemen have closed down. Foreign countries are winding down their rescue operations. This limits our own ability to do much more in Yemen.

The dire situation and the difficulty in tackling the population issue is something we will soon face ourselves.  Singapore is  one of the fastest aging societies in the world.

Today, more than a quarter of Japan's population is aged over 65. This is set to rise to 40 per cent by 2055, when the population will have shrunk from the current 127 million to 90 million. The Japanese government has warned that Japan will need to add one million nurses and care workers by 2025. 

The report looks at the harsh economic and social realities of family members looking after their aged relatives.

Likewise in Singapore, we have a  ratio of six working adults to one person above 65 today. In 15 years, it is projected that we will only have two working adults for one person above 65. Our Manpower Ministry predicts that the number of people entering the workforce is going to come down sharply in 4 years. 

This year 95,000 people will enter the workforce. By 2019, only 20,000 will be entering the workforce. These are  serious issues.

On Japan, the BBC report noted encouraging immigration may seem like a simple solution - but it's not a popular one. Japan is a highly homogenous society and has always struggled with absorbing foreigners into society. It said the service industry, which hires foreign students as part-time employees, also received harsh feedback, especially at the beginning, from those unused to dealing with foreigners.

The report is worth a read. And for us to reflect.

453,2015-03-23 09:08:52,"Mr Lee is no more.

I am tearing as I write this.

What is there to say about Mr Lee Kuan Yew that has not already been said?

On the broad canvas that Mr Lee made, millions of good life stories were written in Singapore.

Mr Lee made these life stories possible: People who started out with almost nothing and moved up to better lives, better jobs, better flats.

In this small city, with peace, harmony and security.

My life story is in many ways the life story of many Singaporeans.

I was born in March 1959. Mr Lee and the PAP first won elections in May 1959, two months after I was born.

Like most Singaporeans, I was a direct beneficiary of Mr Lee’s policies. These policies created a society based on meritocracy, equal opportunities, clean and efficient government, good education for all.

My family had no social capital and very little economic capital.

Mr Lee and his policies ensured that neither my background nor the colour of my skin, nor my religion, were hurdles in getting opportunities. I got a good education in a neighbourhood primary school, got into RI, got into law school and had no difficulty getting a job. 

My family moved to a 3-room flat in 1975 – our first property. And we upgraded after that.

My brother and I graduated. We were able to give a good upbringing to our children.

This story, in broad terms is the story of Singapore, and the story of most Singaporeans – in that many of us started with very little, but all of us were all offered good educational opportunities, decent jobs and better housing.

The vast majority of Singaporeans benefitted. How well we did, and where we ended up, depended on individual effort and some luck.

Singapore is almost unique in the post-World War II world in having started so poor and succeeding so well.
 
Mr Lee and his team made that possible.

His intellect, fervour and passion for Singapore and Singaporeans won him the respect of global leaders like Richard Nixon, Deng Xiaoping, George H W Bush, Bill Clinton, Henry Kissinger, Tony Blair, Margaret Thatcher and other world leaders.

Mr Lee has been described by global leaders as “the preeminent elder statesman of our generation,” a strategic thinker, a political mastermind, an individual with “a steadfast voice of reason, clarity and hope.”

He put Singapore on the world map.

I first met Mr Lee when I was 28. He was amongst those who interviewed me before deciding to field me as a candidate for elections. He questioned me on a variety of topics for 45 minutes. It was an unforgettable experience.

Over the years, I have dealt with him on different issues.

The Mr Lee I dealt with was a practical, no-nonsense man. His sharp intellect meant going straight to the heart of any issue. There was no small talk or superficiality. Every breathing moment for him was spent thinking about Singapore and Singaporeans. There was an unwavering tenacity to ensure that Singapore succeeded.

I had never imagined a Singapore without Mr Lee. 

But as he lay in hospital, on life support, I began to think of what I had never wanted to accept: that we are likely to lose Mr Lee.

Each time I think about him now, I tear. Each time I read a tribute to him, I choke. It is difficult to describe in words, the grief I feel.

Mr Lee himself was matter-of-fact about death: He said: “I am not given to making sense out of life – or coming up with some grand narrative on it – other than to measure it by what you think you want to do in life. As for me, I have done what I had wanted to, to the best of my ability. I am satisfied.”

Everywhere you turn: from the housing estates, the clean and efficient roads, the corruption-free system, the schools, the world-class universities, the leading financial centre that we are today, the good jobs and good quality of life our people have, the hospitals, the clean green environment, the vibrancy of this metropolis, the fact that it is now one of the great cities of the world with a GDP almost equal to that of Malaysia, a much bigger country, with a bigger population and a huge amount of resources. Mr Lee was the chief architect of the system that produced all of this. Mr Lee oversaw the transformation of Singapore.

Very few have made so much difference to so many in so little time.

No one else has built a country out of almost nothing, and in the face of so much adversity.

Singapore without Mr Lee Kuan Yew will never be the same.

Mr Lee’s speeches are full of passion and very inspiring. I included clips that feature such speeches by Mr Lee.

May God bless his soul.

At that time, a donation drive from Singaporeans by the Singapore Red Cross raised over S$35 million to aid the disaster relief and reconstruction efforts in Japan - one of the largest sums contributed by Singapore to such efforts in a foreign country.
 
Saw the ongoing reconstruction efforts in Rikuzentakata today. Their progress is encouraging. I wish them well.
 
Singapore was involved in four reconstruction projects across the Tohoku region after the 2011 disasters. The largest of these is a multi-purpose community hall in Rikuzentakata, which I opened this morning. It is an enduring symbol of the Friendship between Singapore and Japan.",4,27,612,0,0,0,0,0

I focused on three areas: helping litigants, improvements to the family justice system and our efforts in helping Singapore law practices to expand regionally.
 
Helping litigants
 
The government will play a bigger role in criminal legal aid. We are enhancing the Law Society’s Criminal Legal Aid Scheme. More people will be able to receive more legal services.
 
The enhanced CLAS will be launched in two weeks. It has already received strong support from volunteer lawyers and law firms. More details of the enhanced CLAS will be announced at its launch.
 
Family Justice
 
Reforms were made to the Family Justice system last year.
 
We have to minimise the anguish of families going through divorce, and to protect the children involved. Family lawyers have told us that they are supportive of these changes.
 
Building on this, the Ministry of Law will be reviewing other family-related legislation and looking into strengthening the enforcement of maintenance orders to help those in need.
 
Regionalisation of Singapore law practices
 
With dedicated world-class facilities for international commercial arbitration, litigation and mediation collectively in place, Singapore is now able to offer the full suite of dispute resolution services to commercial users.
 
Local lawyers and law firms will benefit as their caseloads increase with the entry of work which would otherwise not have come to our shores. This will also help local law practices expand and tap into the many opportunities in the region.

WP say they represent the poor man on the street.  Instead, they have taken money from the man on the street to pay their friends.

In this video, we know they over-charged Aljunied residents $6.4 million. The money went to FMSS.

Maybe there was no one taking money through the back door in the dark of the night. There was no need to. 

The money was taken from the front door. In broad daylight.

In layman’s terms: 

They have a business with cash, valuables belonging to the people.

They don’t know what is there

They put friends in charge.

The friends then overpay themselves several million dollars and they are not checked.

Even their own auditors say the accounts are unreliable.

They have no clear idea of what has happened to the cash 

And they say no money is lost.",115,166,675,0,0,0,0,0
484,2015-02-13 08:02:59,"I made a speech in Parliament yesterday on the unlawful way in which money was paid out of Aljunied Town Council. There are many serious questions need to be addressed. The Town Council has lost money while FMSS, its management agent, owned by the GM and Secretary of the Town Council,  has made significant profits. For example, the TC overpaid FMSS – by paying much higher fees. Probably in excess of $6 million. And they probably paid nearly $20 million in very questionable ways to FMSS over 4 years. This is the people’s money which has been taken out and given to party supporters .


Here are the key points of my speech:


1. Unlawful actions, breach of fiduciary duties
_______________________________________________

FMSS is owned by Mr Loh, Ms How and Mr Yeo, who had close links to WP and were party supporters. The payments they were verifying and/or approving on behalf of the Town Council, were going into their own companies 

Mr Loh and Ms How were issuing invoices on behalf of FMSS 

Mr Loh and Ms How were then verifying on behalf of the Town Council the work done by FMSS. 

They were certifying on behalf of the Town Council the payment by the Town Council to their own company 

Ms How was then approving on behalf of the Town Council the cheques for payment to FMSS 

Mr Loh was signing the Town Council cheques, for payment to FMSS. 

Allowing this structure is unlawful. This structure cannot be approved by law. 

Town Councillors who approved such a process would be in serious breach of fiduciary duties 

Money paid out in this way, just in one year - $6.6 million. Over 4 years the amount will not be much less than $20 million.

	
2. Aljunied Town Council suffered a loss as a result of the transfers
_______________________________________________


Overcharging for all contracts related to management agents:  Probably around $6.4 million. 

And consider the $20 million or so that must have been paid out under item 1 – there will be some double counting, but nevertheless we are talking very big amounts paid to FMSS.


3. No transparency and accountability
______________________________________________

Refer to Annex 1

FMSS allowed to pay themselves without proper disclosure of ownership 

No discussion on how to mitigate risks from conflict of interest 

Again, a breach of fiduciary duties

Refused to give information to their own auditors Foo Kon Tan Grant Thornton LLP 

Refused to give information to PriceWaterHouseCoopers – who were appointed as part of the AGO audit 

Refused to disclose information on related parties as required by FRS – this is in breach of the law

Consistent pattern of concealment 


4. Individual responsibility of each elected Councillor
___________________________________________


Any honest Town Councillor will admit that all this is unacceptable and will want to set right what has gone wrong.

This includes:

Come clean on the facts
Relook the contracts and payments
Recover the overpayments and payments made in breach of fiduciary duties
Take legal action where necessary

Aljunied residents deserve real, honest answers. The WP has to come clean and explain themselves to the public.

Read a funny article in Tamil Murasu on Saturday. It was about a temple elephant named Ruku, in Tamil Nadu.

Ruku went on a retreat to be with other elephants and relax. 

Ruku weighed 4.9 tonnes before it went on the retreat. It weighed 5.4 tonnes after the retreat! Talk about weight gain!

So doctors have now put Ruku on an exercise and diet regimen. Ruku has to walk 2km every day. And no rice for Ruku! (the article states no rice, but is not clear because it also states that Ruku gets a type of rice).

I had spoken to business owners in Little India about why we need to introduce the Public Order (Additional Temporary Measures) Act. 

A riot had occurred on 8 Dec 2013. The immediate task was to put in measures to ensure the safety and security of residents, visitors and other stakeholders in Little India. The residents wanted the government to take action.
 
The residents tell us that Little India feels safer now, after the measure were put in place. Residents no longer face disamenities that arise from excessive drinking, e.g. rowdy behaviour, public urination and vomiting, fights. In the meantime, people have returned to Little India, back to the pre-riot levels.
 
However, some shops that have relied heavily on liquor sales to foreign workers on weekends have been affected by the new measures. The government will work with LISHA to see how we can help these affected business owners, including you. For instance, we have arranged for many of the LISHA members to open shops in recreation centres, patronised by many foreign workers. Some of these owners have adjusted their business models and are doing well.
 
The government is now looking at introducing a new law to better control the supply and excessive consumption of alcohol island wide. Extensive public consultations were conducted and there is strong support from the public, for the introduction of measures, to control the supply and consumption of liquor.
 
We will work collectively to develop a responsible drinking culture in a safe and secure environment.",26,31,610,0,0,0,0,0

Victims can also claim for damages separately.  In very egregious cases, harassers may also face criminal prosecution.  These two measures will complement the Protection Order, creating a ladder of remedies for victims.
 
However, harassment cannot be dealt with by laws alone. Each of us has a part to play in cultivating community norms, and educating each other on what constitutes socially acceptable behaviour.
 
Our children have a right to grow up in a safe environment, free from discrimination and bullying by peers. We should be free from intimidating, hostile and abusive environment, be it at home or at the workplace, online or offline.

________________________________________________________

Following the recent shootings in Paris, I instructed our Ambassador to France to represent the Singapore Government in the March of Unity held last Sunday in the French capital, as a demonstration of our solidarity with France, in standing against the barbaric attacks. I also went to the French Embassy in Singapore yesterday to sign the condolence book. This was what I wrote:

“Singaporeans stand with the people of France. We condemn in the strongest terms, the barbaric violence resulting in the tragic loss of so many lives.

Our thoughts are with the families of the victims. We wish speedy recovery to those who were injured.

We are confident that the French nation will prove its resilience once again and deal with this challenge in a determined way.

The March in Unity is an eloquent testimony to the spirit of the French people and the solidarity of the rest of the free world, with France.”",25,28,1073,0,0,0,0,0

________________________________________________________

This evening I delivered the eulogy for my dear friend Subhas at Mandai Crematorium. Here is the full text:

“Vimala, Sujesh, Friends,
 
All of us offer our deepest condolences to Vimala and Sujesh.
 
Many have said much about Subhas. The outpouring of grief is testimony to the lives Subhas has touched.
 
Why, you can ask?
 
And it's not just the usual explanations,
not just his intellect,
not just his abilities in court,
not just that he had a very big heart,
not just that he had a very big personality.
 
There is something quintessentially Subhas which is all of this and much more. A good person, a noble character and who cared deeply for others and society. When you met him, you felt that about him, that he is a rare person, and you get drawn to him. From the goodness of his heart, a good man who was no one's fool, but always acting in the best interests of his clients and society.
 
We have lost a great man.
It is our loss,
it is our country's loss,
and the country mourns his departure.
 
The media, print, radio, TV, is awash with stories, a testimony to the standing Subhas had.
 
Social media is inundated with condolence messages from all sections of society.
 
Three months ago, we had a tribute event organized by the Association of Muslim lawyers. I was the Guest of Honour.  It was for a fund . Aim was to give ex-prison inmates a second chance in life, named after Subhas. At that event, he spoke movingly of his love for his family and friends in the legal fraternity, and his desire to advance the cause of justice and fair representation. In a way, it has turned out to be a fitting finale for a great lawyer.
 
I met him earlier last year, he was not feeling so good, and he was talking to me about why he is still here. 

By the time September, October came, he was looking much better and we were all hopeful. 

So it was a great shock to hear the news. He has left an indelible mark on the lives of family, friends, and the lawyers of the court. Many people spoke at the AML event and they spoke from their hearts.
 
 To his family, Vimala and Sujesh, Subhas was a loving husband and a loving father who often lamented that he should have spent more time with you. His love for you, Vimala, is expressed from these words he said to you just before he was wheeled into the operating theatre in 2008: ""I see your face in every rose, I see your smile in every cloud.""

Sujesh, your dad is immensely proud of your achievements, and it was one of the proudest moments of his life when you told him of your decision to take up law.

To the legal fraternity, Subhas was like an elder brother. His 40 years of experience in overcoming the odds in court, in cases that had originally seemed to be lost, made him a legend in the criminal bar, his incisive intellect and dogged perseverance were tempered by a sharp wit and infectious sense of humor.

To the people he defended, and the general public, he was a hero.

His reputation for taking up the toughest cases, often pro bono, and then succeeding against odds, made him a mainstay in the news, and a beacon of hope to the accused that he defended.

All this came from his steadfast belief in fair representation and in second chances. He was a fierce and combative champion of these principles and he was never shy in letting me know his views.

I consider Subhas a dear friend and have always found him to be upright, honest, full of integrity and wit. After the October event, he suggested that we have lunch. I agreed, he gave me a date. My diary is run by my PA, I forgot to tell her. At about 12.45pm on a Sunday afternoon, perhaps 1pm, he called me and said, ""Where are you?"" Thankfully I happened to be free and rushed down, and I'm glad I did.
 
I am, together with each one of you, saddened by his passing,
but his legacy will live on, in his writings, in the legal textbooks containing accounts of his cases, newspapers, websites,
and most importantly, in our hearts.

Even though he has passed on, he will live forever as a loving father, loving husband, a gentleman at the Bar and a dear friend to all of us.
 
We mourn together.",222,415,4282,0,0,0,0,0

Described by many as a titan in criminal law, Subhas’ name is synonymous with tenaciousness in court, a sharp intellect and above all, a generous heart. Subhas’ strong sense of justice, has made him a legal legend to the Bar as well as general public. His unswerving belief in fair representation for the accused, and granting them a second chance in life, makes him an inspiring role model for the rest of the Criminal Bar.
 
My heart is filled with sadness with Subhas’ passing.
 
Many will join me in extending our deepest condolences to his family during this difficult time, and would like them to know that the legal fraternity grieves with them.

523,2015-01-04 09:04:04,"I have been following the issue of stray cats in Nee Soon South. Some of the residents have been irresponsible in feeding stray cats without observing the proper hygiene procedures and follow-ups. This has led to unhappiness amongst residents over hygiene and inconvenience.
 
The MP in the constituency, Dr Lee Bee Wah, has the responsibility to deal with the issue – because her residents are complaining to her.
  
There has been a lot of false statements about what she has done/intends to do. Dr Lee, when she received the complaints, first approached the cat welfare activists on how to deal with the problem. She also polled residents on how they would like to deal with the stray cats. And she engaged cat lovers and tried to explain the situation and listen to their feedback.

No decision has been made on what to do with the cats, as yet. Dr Lee intends to work with the Cat Welfare Society, cat lovers and the relevant agencies to come up with solutions that would make sense for all.

One person who attended one of the engagement meetings went online to make untrue allegations, misrepresenting the discussions, and claiming that a decision has been made to cull the cats when that was simply untrue.

If we want to be a civil society solving problems together, we need to remain truthful, responsible and stick to the facts. It is unproductive to attack those who genuinely try to help and look after the interest of the greater community. Making false allegations sensationalises the situation, but is not a responsible thing to do; and will ultimately impact on how we can operate properly to deal with a community problem.

Just as important, activists have to be mindful there are many people who don’t like the disamenities that are caused by the actions of irresponsible cat feeders. These residents  have rights too. And if they complain to the MP, then the MP has to take action. If they are in the majority, then their wishes cannot be disregarded, simply because a (smaller) group is more vocal. Those who don’t want the cats to be culled should come forward to suggest solutions, to help the residents. Dr Lee Bee Wah has tried to do that – by forming a group, comprising animal lovers, to see what can be done.",133,142,1132,0,0,0,0,0

______________

Subhas Anandan has handled over 1,500 cases in his  career. He is one of our best known criminal lawyers. In recognition of Subhas’ work, the Association of Muslim Lawyers held a tribute event  on Tuesday where they launched the Yellow Ribbon Fund .The award is called the Subhas Anandan Star Bursary Award.
 
It  will provide financial support to ex-inmates who wish to further their studies, and help give them a second chance in their lives.
 
I attended the event. It was quite a moving  experience to hear people speak about Subhas. Subhas also delivered a touching speech where he thanked judges, colleagues and his family for standing by him during his recent bouts of severe  illness.

I am glad that Subhas is practicing once again. All of us wish him the very best.

573,2014-10-27 09:59:49,"When I was in New York last month (for the UN meetings), I arranged to meet a Singaporean lady, Shirin Hamid (shown in the picture). She has been with the United Nations Development Programme as its Chief Technology Officer for the past nine years, and was recently awarded the Top 100 Premier Global IT Leader in 2014 by Computerworld. Although she and her husband and two children now live in New York, they make it a point to keep abreast of developments in Singapore.

We spoke about her family. Shirin told me that her late father had served in the Singapore Police Force, retiring as an assistant superintendent, while her mother is still active in social and community work even at the age of 74.

Shirin’s eldest brother, Farid, was formerly a police officer and deputy public prosecutor. Farid was also the first director of Singapore International Foundation's Youth Expedition Project in 2000-2005, and was hired by the Brunei Government to establish Outward Bound Brunei Darussalam.

Her other brother, Zakir, was the first Malay RSAF pilot in 1992, and previously served as Commanding Officer of 112 Squadron. Zakir is currently the RSAF liaison to the Pacific Air Forces at Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam in Hawaii.

Shirin’s elder sister, Zabrina, is a partner in a Singapore-based law firm, heading its Property Law department. Zabrina has worked on a number of legal publications, having held various editorial positions including editor and specialist editor with global legal publisher LexisNexis.

Shirin and her siblings have done very well in their respective careers. Shirin tells me that her parents were very focused on investing in their children’s education. Ultimately, this is what makes the most difference: the attention parents pay to their children, the values of the parents, and the parents’ emphasis on education.",126,342,3251,0,0,0,0,0

I explained Singapore’s position and experience on the death penalty and how we have been successful in tackling the serious problems of drug abuse, trafficking and related serious crimes.  One of the main reasons that our society is one of the safest in the world is that we take a very tough approach on drugs and related crimes.  If a drug trafficker trafficks in a quantity which can supply 300 drug abusers for a week, he could face the death penalty. This is not revenge; this is not vengeance.  This is based on the principle of deterrence and clear rule of law.

As a result, we have been able to keep our country, our people, our children safe. Many who argued against death penalty put a lot of their focus on people who face the death penalty. Not enough attention is put on their victims. Drug traffickers impose immense penalties, including the death penalty, on their victims. Thousands of people die from drugs and related crimes. We have stopped that in Singapore while countries around the world are losing the war on drugs. We want to protect our people from becoming victims, and to protect our society. Here are the news reports of my remarks at the UN.

 I met Lai Hock and his team shortly after and again at a function organised by GUI. I then appealed on behalf of the young people involved in the project. GUI’s lease was extended a few times following a series of appeals.

 When the lease for BottleTree Park expired this year, it had to be put up for open tender – since ultimately the rental paid is taxpayer money.

 When interviewed by Lianhe Wanbao, the new bidder has stated that they would like to preserve the ""kampong spirit"" of the original BottleTree Park, and work with GUI. Both parties have plans to work together. Hopefully this happens.

 Through the support of various government agencies, GUI was also able to expand from their existing 1,300 square metres to 26,000 square metres to try and achieve their vision.

The Sisters received a lot of kind assistance from many Church volunteers. The Sisters and their volunteers have done a tremendous job with the new centre. It looks beautiful. And with modern facilities, it is extremely user friendly – though it took some getting used to see all the Sisters carrying electronic entry passes, which is needed for them to get around the premises!

They have made it homely and welcoming, and have planted various fruit trees on the premises.

The Mission looks after some children – they were lovely, charming and friendly. The Mission also runs kindergartens, as it did in the previous premises.

And the Chapel is a real oasis of peace and calm.

626,2014-08-27 11:00:00,"The Economist recently noted that Singapore is the safest country in the world (for those with population more than a million.) Singapore registered 11 murders in the year 2012. That’s one murder in every 480,000 persons. On the other hand, in Honduras, the world’s most violent country, one in every 1,100 residents was killed.  
 
It is worth noting that we also have a very high solutions rate for murder - which is somewhere in the region of 90 per cent, against the global solutions rate of about 43 per cent..
 
But we have to be vigilant. A recent research study of Singapore’s homicide trends from 1955 to 2011 by two MHA senior officers Tai Wei Shyong (now Chief Prosecutor in AGC) and Tang Gek Hsien is interesting.
 
The authors noted that in recent years, there have been instances of group violence in Singapore between male gangs which have led to deaths. While our homicide rates remain low, it is not possible to eradicate violence altogether.
 
They wisely warned that it was important for us, from a policy perspective, not to assume that historical murder rates will not rise again, if there are changes in our social structures and norms.  Instances of violence should be reviewed regularly to see if the current legal and enforcement frameworks can be more targeted and, hence, more effective. We need to watch out for emerging sub-cultures of violence among socially disenfranchised groups.

 ii. Israel’s response has been disproportionate. Israel can and should do more to ensure that civilian casualties are minimised.

 2. Hamas is deliberately using civilians as shields. The Hamas spokesman Sami Abu Zuhri had gone on Gaza national television and said that the human-shield strategy has proven “very effective”. This is a deliberate strategy. President of the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) Mahmoud Abbas has accused Hamas of using civilians and has said, “What are you trying to achieve by sending rockets?... I do not like trading in Palestinian blood.” There has not been one rocket from the West Bank, controlled by PNA.

 3. Israel needs to show greater commitment to the two-state solution, and should comply with its international law obligations. And Hamas should stop its attacks on Israel, and change its intention to destroy Israel. 

 If indeed it is a pure targeting of innocent civilians, that is completely unacceptable. It is an international crime and we would support prosecution under international criminal laws.

 4. We have supported the Palestinians in their legitimate aspirations.
 i. Last year, at the United Nations General Assembly, Singapore voted for all 17 Palestinian-related resolutions.
 ii. We have consistently supported the right of Palestinians to have their own state.
 iii. I met the PNA FM last year.
 iv. We also supported visits from Ministers from PNA to Singapore. 
 v. Indeed, we financially support that: since 2013, we have been participating in the Conference on Cooperation among East Asian Countries for Palestinian Development, or CEAPAD. 

 During CEAPAD I in Tokyo last year, we announced Singapore’s enhanced technical assistance package for the PNA, worth at five million Singapore dollars for five years, which is more than what several of our regional countries have pledged. Under this package, we have received several delegations and study visits.

 vi. Senior Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Masagos Zulkifli met with the PNA Prime Minister during CEAPAD II in Jakarta, early this year. And SMS Masagos encouraged the Prime Minister to send more Palestinians to Singapore under this package.

 5. There is a limit to what Singapore can do to solve the crisis. We do not have much leverage on either side even though we have relationships with Israel, the PNA and several Arab countries. 

 6. We will support the UN in the role that it has taken. We support the decision of the Human Rights Council in Geneva to establish an independent Commission of Inquiry to investigate all violations of international law, including violations of humanitarian law. 

 7. We say that all parties involved should cooperate in that inquiry. There is also a limit to what the international community can do. The number killed in Syria over the past two years is 180,000. Thousands of innocent children and women have been killed. This is more than the number killed in Palestine in 20 years – yet, there was not much that the international community could do in the Syrian case. And thousands have been killed in Sunni-Shia conflict in Iraq in the last 12 months. Again, there is not much that the international community can do. 

 Political will is needed to overcome the problems and bring an end to the conflict.

Mr Nathan’s story is an inspiring one for all of us – his strong sense of duty took him from very humble beginnings to the highest office in the land. It is also an example of what is possible in Singapore - in few countries can a person of his background achieve what he achieved.

It is due to the hard work, resilience, and sacrifices of Mr Nathan and others in his generation that Singapore enjoys the success that it has today. We have much to thank these pioneers for.

Enclosed below are my remarks made at the book launch, a news report about the event: http://news.asiaone.com/news/singapore/former-president-s-r-nathans-memoirs-now-tamil#sthash.qdqibP5X.dpuf and also a related Vasantham Tamil News clip. 

###  
REMARKS AT THE BOOK LAUNCH
 
It is an honour and pleasure to launch the Tamil-language version of Mr S.R. Nathan’s memoirs, “An Unexpected Journey: Path to the Presidency”.
 
Mr Nathan led a varied and successful life, packed with enough incident for several lifetimes and several careers.
 
As his wife, Umi, wrote in an afterword to the English-language version: “On more than one occasion I thought he had reached the end of a successful career and could look forward to retirement. Each time a new call has come and he has responded. We both feel that in answering the summons we are repaying a debt to Singapore…”
 
Mr Nathan’s strong sense of duty took him from very humble beginnings to the highest office in the land.
 
His is an inspiring story of what an individual, starting from almost literally nothing in the most unpropitious of circumstances, can through native intelligence, resolution, and application achieve.
 
His is also a uniquely Singapore story. His life is an example and a vindication of the Singapore system.  In few countries can a man of his provenance achieve what he did.

We have become a very different and successful society today.  The differences are due to the hard work and sacrifices of Mr Nathan and his generation.  The opportunities for advancement are there, and have multiplied, thanks to the achievements of Mr Nathan’s generation.
 
Naturally, today there are new challenges – some of them very serious ones.
 
But life is a constant challenge.  I do not think anybody wants to return to the old poverty-stricken, unstable, indeed dangerous Singapore that Mr Nathan and his generation faced.
 
His life shows how with determination, even the most serious of challenges can be overcome. He never just grumbled, but rolled up his sleeves and set to work.
 
Let me again quote Mr Nathan’s wife: “There is a lesson in his story for all young people, however competitive the world may seem.”
 
As Singapore’s 6th Foreign Minister, I was fortunate to inherit an institution that Mr Nathan, more than any other single individual officer, did most to shape, when he was Permanent Secretary in the late 1970s and early 1980s.
 
It was not always so.
 
Singapore did not expect to become an independent country. Since 1959, we had some experience of internal self-government, but foreign affairs, like defence, was the responsibility of first, the British, and after 1963, the federal Malaysian authorities in Kuala Lumpur.
 
So when we became unexpectedly independent in 1965, we were almost totally unprepared. We had to create a foreign ministry on the fly in the midst of many more urgent and immediate priorities.
 
Older officers tell me that I cannot imagine how it was in the early days: people without training, a young country without any established foreign policy structure.
 
In the early days, Mr Lee Kuan Yew and first generation leaders like Mr S. Rajaratnam, and Dr Goh Keng Swee, took direct charge of foreign affairs.
 
But we obviously could not continue that way. And so, as it had many times in many different fields, the government turned to Mr Nathan to set things in order.
 
I never worked with Mr Nathan in the Foreign Ministry. So I asked one of the older officers who was a junior officer when Mr Nathan was Permanent Secretary to tell me what Mr Nathan did to transform the Ministry into the highly professional organisation it has become.
 
Let me share with you the three lessons that he told me Mr Nathan imparted to young officers. The three lessons made a deep imprint on the then young officers – he in turn tried to impart them to a new generation of Foreign Service Officers. I think they have a wider application than just to the Foreign Ministry.
 
First, do not be distracted by peripherals, and get to the core of any situation or problem. And having identified and analysed the core issue, express yourself succinctly, clearly and directly. Or as he recalled Mr Nathan was wont to say ""cut out the long palaver and get to the point"".  This may seem obvious, even trite.  But I can assure you that this is rarer than you may think.
 
Second, your duty is to serve the national interest of Singapore. Do your duty without fear. Do not be deterred by either any external opposition or, which is perhaps sometimes more difficult, by the necessity of telling your own superiors unpleasant realities. He told me that once, having confessed to something which did not turn out very well, Mr Nathan asked him rhetorically: “What’s the worst that can happen to you? Will you be hanged? Get on with your work.”  This, he said, gave him an entirely new perspective on life.
 
And third, Mr Nathan valued steadfastness and loyalty in his staff, and in turn gave them his loyalty, however junior they may have been.  Or as he puts it, “if our rears deserved to be kicked, and they often did, he kicked our rears himself and defended us to others. He took responsibility for our actions and never hung us out to dry.”
 
Henry Kissinger is said to have once described Singapore’s foreign policy as “cold blooded”. Perhaps. But that attitude has enabled us to survive and prosper in a dangerous and uncertain world. And we lose it only to our detriment.
 
I do not mean to suggest that Mr Nathan is cold blooded. On the contrary, all who know him, know him as a very humble and compassionate person whose sympathies were instinctively with the less fortunate, and those qualities infuse his memoirs.
 
But there is a time and place for everything; a time for compassion and a time to do one’s duty regardless and be kind afterwards. Mr Nathan knew that.
 
Mr Nathan was not only a committed public servant. His memoirs reveal his deep attachment to his family, his friends, and to all Singaporeans. And of course, his services to the Indian and Hindu community: He played the key role in transforming the Hindu Endowments Board (HEB) into a professional organisation. He played the key role in ensuring that the HEB temples are well-managed, and provide good service to devotees.
 
Just over a week ago, Mr Nathan celebrated his 90th birthday. A celebration was held in his honour. I was in India on my first official visit to the new Indian government and could not attend. So allow me to conclude by taking this opportunity to wish him many more productive, successful, and healthy years.
 
Again his wife puts it best, and it is fitting that I give her the last word: “Even today he hates holidays and always needs a task. His mind has to be active”.  So expect Mr Nathan to be actively thinking of something.  In fact I know he is thinking of a couple of things – he has told me.",12,1,471,0,0,0,0,0
676,2014-07-09 20:06:54,"We had put up an Expression Wall early this year, at the Amphitheatre in Chong Pang City. It was hugely successful, with many people expressing their views. We put up another wall last week. This time we were hoping to hear ideas, views, thoughts on how we can develop quality wellness and care centres for our elderly.
 
The response from the residents has been overwhelming. We kept the wall for extra days, and had to add more writing space, using sheets – just like the last time. It has also been fun for residents to express themselves creatively as well as reading the views and drawings of others.
 
We have captured every comment on the wall, including taking pictures and videos of them. This is important because some of the residents have written over the comments of others. There were some rude comments and  graffiti as well. Some were drawn by little kids. This is to be expected. There were also negative comments and complaints by residents on policies which they want changed – these were genuine expression of views. People are entitled to disagree with government policies and give their views. This is what this expression wall is all about.
 
Unfortunately, there was also some unconstructive element to it. Some Opposition supporters (clearly identifiable because of what they did) decided to co-ordinate and hijack the Wall – defacing the Wall, writing over other comments, scratching out existing comments, and standing by the Wall and asking people to write down negative comments, calling for the death of one of our founding fathers. They also took screen shots of the negative comments which they themselves wrote, presumably so that they can post them on line and pretend that that these were comments by residents. (We noted they quickly took pictures of such negative comments and posted them on some websites). One such  writer scribbled across a section of the wall to cancel out dozens of good suggestions, and wrote very prominently the name of the political party he supported. We did not stop them. People can judge for themselves what such a behaviour means. He and some others believe that freedom of expression means that only their views should be seen, and so he needed to scratch out the positive comments.( As I have said earlier some of the comments which were critical of policies were honest expression of views by residents. The unconstructive behaviour was exhibited by only a few, though they attempted to scratch out large parts).

Despite all this co-ordinated effort, it is heartening that that the majority – about 90 per cent of the comments – were positive or constructive. We will review the comments in greater detail and do an update later. We were able to tabulate because we kept track of all the comments, including those which were scratched out, written over, so we know what all the comments were. We will send all the feedback to the relevant agencies.

Mr Yang Tiong Hock has suggested that we empower our consular officers, more, to make decisions with regard to the issuance of Document of Identity (DOI).  
 
The DOI is an emergency travel document that facilitates a Singaporean’s return home when his/her passport has been lost while abroad. We are quite strict about the issuing of DOIs. 

Security is our main concerns as those who wish to do Singapore harm, could exploit DOIs to come to Spore, if we did not have strict protocols. We therefore require Singaporeans to appear in person at our Missions for the issuance of the DOI to ensure proper verification of identity. Understandably this will be difficult in locations where a Singapore diplomatic mission is not present. 
 
Our officers can and do exercise flexibility on a case-by-case basis, so long as Singapore’s security is not compromised. 

The case of Mr Yang’s brother was one such example. Mr Yang was in Istanbul, and did not wish to go to Ankara where our Embassy was, to obtain the DOI. Our Consul General in Istanbul was travelling. The usual rule will be for a consular officer to meet with Mr Yang, verify his identity, before the DOI is issued. In this case, given the facts, our Embassy in Ankara waived the usual protocol, issued the DOI and couriered it to Mr Yang in Istanbul a day after his brother was found. Both brothers departed Istanbul for Singapore the following day.",23,14,414,0,0,0,0,0

697,2014-06-05 12:21:34,"Can the government get involved if a Singaporean gets illegal sexual services overseas, but is not satisfied and wants a refund ? The answer seems obvious. But it was not obvious to one person at least.

Some days ago, I wrote on the work done by MFA officers providing consular services. Singaporeans are making more overseas trips, almost 7 million last year compared to 3.6 million a decade ago. From time to time, they run into trouble and seek help from our consular staff. We handled over 3,000 consular cases last year.

Many cases are genuine. But sometimes we do get odd requests. We have to draw the line between what is personal responsibility and what’s not. SPS Sam Tan highlighted some of these cases in Parliament. Here are some of them.
 
1. A Singaporean sought MFA’s assistance for a refund after he had gotten illegal sexual services in a foreign country. He wasn’t satisfied with what he had gotten. We had to tell him that MFA could not help!  
 
 2. We want Singaporeans to marry and have children. But there are limits. A Singaporean had sought MFA's assistance to persuade his foreign girlfriend, to expedite her divorce proceedings with her husband, so that he could marry her. Not something MFA can do.
 
3. Did the chicken come first or egg. Answer? The locals.
MFA received a complaint from a Singaporean, who claimed that he was subjected to racial discrimination overseas, because he received a smaller piece of KFC chicken compared to what the locals had. He wanted MFA to investigate this instance and seek justice in that foreign country for the unfair treatment he claimed to have received. We told him we could not do that.
 
4. Success coach Rob Liana once said everyone has baggage, maybe we should help each other carry it. But sometimes we just have to pay for it. A Singaporean insisted that it was MFA's responsibility to retrieve a kitchen appliance he left behind, in a foreign country, because he had no money to pay for the excess baggage.

Singaporeans made 6.9 million overseas trips in 2013, as compared to 3.6 million a decade ago. The workload of our consular officers has correspondingly grown, both in volume and complexity. More than 3,000 consular cases were handled last year.
 
Our consular officers, both in MFA HQ and at our overseas missions, work hard to help Singaporeans in need of assistance. I have often received emails from Singaporeans who have written to thank and highlight the efforts of our officers, not just for helping in moments of distress, but also for ‘simple’ situations like helping with a lost passport.
 
That said, there are limits to what our consular officers can do. Local laws and international rules sometimes constrain the extent to which we can render assistance, despite our best efforts. 

Sometimes we also receive some truly bizarre or unreasonable requests.

I had given an interview to Business Times, as part of its Raffles Conversation series, six years ago, just before becoming a Minister. 
 
I gave another interview to BT recently, which was published last Saturday (May 17). In the latest interview, a lot of ground was covered - on the many changes that have been made to the legal system, and the importance of getting our international relations right.
 
I also discussed further proposed changes to the legal system. I told BT that my Ministry had set up a Committee to consider some aspects of the Penal Code, including the laws relating to homicide.  
 
I also spoke to BT about cases where death results after a rape, or where after a child has been assaulted.  My personal view ( which I shared in the interview) is that in such cases, the accused should  be required prove that he did not intend to cause death of the rape victim or child.  If the accused cannot prove that, then he should face the death penalty. 
 
The BT interview and and ST article reporting on that interview are attached.

Last week, I went to Nay Pi Taw (NPT), Myanmar on Friday for the ASEAN FMs meeting and came back on Saturday. Travelling to Nay Pi Taw was not easy. You could fly to Yangon and then take a four hour car ride. Or you could fly into Bangkok and catch a connecting flight to NPT. But you may have to wait 3-4 hours in Bangkok because of flight connections.

I spent a total of about 20 hours travelling to NPT and back.

During the ASEAN FMs meeting, we discussed a number of important issues. The troubling developments in the South China Sea (SCS) and the recent tensions were discussed.

I also raised the issue of haze. It is likely that the El Nino effect could be quite severe this year. That means that the haze could be worse in the second half of this year – unless preventative measures are taken. We encouraged Indonesia to ratify the ASEAN Transboundary Haze Treaty quickly. We also encouraged Indonesia to consider adopting the Haze Monitoring System (HMS). The HMS will help to pinpoint the culprits who are responsible for starting fires.",14,21,640,0,0,0,0,0

_____________________
 
Recently as I was driving along Cavenagh Road, I saw something which made me think a lot. 
A domestic helper was walking with a young girl in school uniform. The girl was probably 14, 15 or so. The domestic helper was carrying a heavy bag of grocery and a backpack which looked like the young girl's school bag. The young girl was carrying an umbrella. It had just stopped raining. As I passed the couple, I saw the young girl handing over the umbrella to the house help, and the house help taking it. The girl was then walking, arms completely free. The helper had her grocery bag in one hand, the umbrella in the other hand and the backpack on her back.

Questions went through my mind : to what extent do we as parents teach our children to treat others with compassion and kindness? In Singapore we are lucky that so many of our households have been able to employ domestic help. But do we teach our children to treat our helpers, with respect, compassion? The young girl made the house help carry everything, including the umbrella ( once it was no longer raining), while she had her hands completely free. Will she grow up, learning to treat others with respect, and be considerate ?

This education has to start with parents. We have to treat everyone with a spirit of compassion, kindness, and be considerate.",798,2382,8567,0,0,1,0,0

In some countries, the teachings and practices of Buddhism, particularly on one’s attitude towards living a good, peaceful and fulfilling life has met with an increasingly popular following, even by those who are not practising Buddhists.

Buddha says that all wrong doing arises because of the mind. If the mind is transformed, can wrong-doing remain? It refers to the need to train and develop the mind and to free our minds from limits and negativity. I also like the verse “The thousands of candles can be lit from a single candle, and the life of the candle will not be shortened. Happiness never decreases by being shared’’. Buddha showed us great compassion. We can embrace all living beings without discrimination. 

We sometimes lose our focus amidst the rush, at work, at home, dealing with people. Buddha's words help put things in the right perspective. We can become more focused on what’s important in life. The mind is the source of happiness and unhappiness and we should train it to focus on the positive, goodness and truth, and not dragged down by selfishness, ambitions and negative thoughts.

Wishing all Buddhists a Happy Vesak Day.

In two of the three categories tested, numeracy and technological proficiency, young Americans who are on the cusp of entering the workforce — ages 16 to 24 —rank last, says Mr  Zakaria.
 
Quoting from French economist Thomas Piketty, Mr Zakaria notes that in the long term,  the main force in favour of resolving inequalities is education - or what he calls ""diffusion of knowledge and skills''.
 
Mr Zakaria also points out how  partisan politicking  has prevented good education policies from being implemented – even if a policy is good, it will be opposed for political reasons.  And this has allowed many other countries to overtake America.",7,36,205,0,0,0,0,0

I was struck by  85 year-old Mr Toh . His wife, Mdm Ng is 82 years old and has been hospitalised.

I am told that the competition is getting tougher and tougher every year (as is to be expected). Thus the SMU team’s performance is particularly noteworthy.

It is interesting that the young SMU Law School is doing so well – they have been chosen to represent Singapore, in the last two years. And in the competition itself, they have come in  2nd  on both attempts. This, despite the Law School having started only in 2007.

I wonder if this has to do with the fact that SMU students are Juris Doctor or whether SMU has devised innovative ways to prepare its students for what is a very competitive international competition.  Noteworthy that  Prof Chen Si Yuan, who trains the SMU students, was a Jessup Mooter from NUS. Whatever the reason, congrats are due to SMU Law School.

I am sometimes asked by students whether taking part in such Moot competitions helps in subsequent law practice. I share with them my own experience – I was in the 1984 team which went to Washington. I will say that all four of us in the team felt that we had benefitted from the experience – the training in terms of thinking, research, writing memorials, and presenting arguments clearly.

We had a great teacher in Prof Bob Beckman, who has trained generations of Jessup Mooters, including the current Chief Justice, Attorney-General, Judge of Appeal Justice VK Rajah, my Senior Minister of State for Law, Ms Indranee Rajah, as well as several other top SCs . And the experience of taking part in such a competition cannot simply be measured in terms of whether it makes you a better lawyer ( though I think it undoubtedly does).

Before I took public office, I used to go and judge some of the (internal) Singapore rounds of Jessup Moots. The standards by then were much much higher than our standards in the 80s. Now, I suspect, the standards will have qualitatively gone up again, several notches.

A PISA ranking, which was released Dec 9,  provides some interesting perspectives. Singapore’s 15-year-old kids continued to do well in PISA tests, coming in second in the global ranking - after China for maths. Singapore also had the second highest proportion (12.3%) of students who are top performers in maths, science and reading. Finland, which used to rank among the top countries including leading the table for science and reading a decade ago, has fallen 22 points on its 2009 results with smaller declines (12 points and 9 ) in reading and science. Finland's scores are worsening faster than other countries with falling scores such as Canada and Denmark.

This is based on results for the 2012 Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA), a worldwide study by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).  85,000 students worldwide took part in a computer-based problem-solving test. In another Pisa results published two weeks ago, Singapore students topped the global ranking on creative problem solving. Finland was ranked 10th.

Why this relative decline of Finland? According to The Economist (report attached) quoting the Finnbay news website, the golden days for the Finns are over. Leena Krokfors, an academic in Finland, blames declining motivation and a failure of math teachers and the curriculum to inspire enthusiasm.  Economist quotes some who think that aspects of the Finnish education system may be the reason for the weaker performance. The full Economist report is below. 

While I think the gloomy conclusions on the Finnish education system are overdone,  nevertheless the Economist article shows that there are no easy answers or solutions – in every system, in every country, there are issues.  

The lesson for us : our approach has yielded decent results, our children do well. But we have to continue to try and improve, and cater to children of different abilities, make sure they can all be helped to maximise their potential. Everyone can achieve in some way.

In response to media queries on Ambassador-At-Large Professor Tommy Koh receiving the 2014 Great Negotiator Award at Harvard Law School on 10 April 2014, Minister for Foreign Affairs and Minister for Law K Shanmugam noted that Ambassador Koh has served with great distinction in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, including having served as Singapore’s Permanent Representative to the United Nations in New York, Ambassador to the United States of America, Ambassador to Mexico and High Commissioner to Canada.  

In extending his congratulations to Ambassador Koh, Minister Shanmugam said: “I am delighted that Tommy’s achievements as a diplomat and negotiator, which were always celebrated in Singapore, have been recognised by the Harvard Law School and the Kennedy School of Government.  Tommy is of course well-known internationally for having guided the historic 3rd UN Conference on the Law of the Sea and the Rio Earth Summit to successful conclusion.  Tommy was also Singapore’s Chief Negotiator for the US-Singapore Free Trade Agreement, whose 10th anniversary we are celebrating this year.  He also chaired the negotiations that produced the ASEAN Charter.  In all of these occasions, Tommy has displayed the tremendous skills and typical grace of the consummate negotiator.  The award cannot be more well-deserved.”

MFA Press Statement: Visit of Minister for Foreign Affairs and Minister for Law K Shanmugam to the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka (2 to 5 April 2014)
 
Minister for Foreign Affairs and Minister for Law K Shanmugam made a visit to the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka from 2 to 5 April 2014. In Colombo, Minister Shanmugam called on the President of Sri Lanka, HE Mahinda Rajapaksa, and had discussions with his Sri Lankan counterpart Minister of External Affairs, Prof G L Peiris, and the Secretary of Defence and Urban Development, Gotabhaya Rajapaksa.
 
During his meetings, Minister Shanmugam discussed the positive progress in bilateral ties between Singapore and Sri Lanka, as well as various possible avenues to expand and deepen the existing bilateral cooperation between the two countries. Minister Shanmugam also signed a revised Avoidance of Double Taxation Agreement with Minister Peiris.
 
Minister Shanmugam visited Jaffna and met with the Governor of the Northern Province G.A. Chandrasiri, the Chief Minister of the Northern Province C.V. Vigneswaran, and the Mayor of Jaffna Yogeswary Pathkunarajah. During the meetings, they updated Minister Shanmugam on recent developments in Jaffna. Chief Minister Vigneswaran spoke candidly about the challenges facing his administration. He said that the circumstances which the Administration found itself in, as well as the restrictions being imposed on it, were making it very difficult for his Administration to carry out its duties. 
 
In Jaffna, Minister witnessed the inauguration of several projects to help the young people of Jaffna. These included: (i) the Singapore International Foundation (SIF)’s project to enhance competency in the English language by training teachers and librarians to assist students better; (ii) a youth resource centre at the Jaffna Public Library where students can learn through interactive activities; and (iii) a mobile library which was donated by Singapore donors (i.e., the Modern Montessori International and the Singapore Ceylon Tamils’ Association).  Singapore’s National Library Board (NLB) also donated more than 10,000 books to the Jaffna Public Library.  It is expected that over 3,000 students in 38 schools in Jaffna will benefit from these projects.
 
During his visit to Jaffna, Minister Shanmugam also met the media. In response to queries on the reconciliation process, Minister Shanmugam said there were a number of facets to the issue, and highlighted two of the facets. First, was the question of finding an acceptable closure in respect to the events of the civil war which ended in 2009; and second, the redevelopment process that would be needed to help the people of Jaffna.
 
On the first issue, Minister Shanmugam said to the media that it was best for a closure to be achieved which was just and equitable, and acceptable to all the different communities, including the Sinhalese, Tamil and Muslim communities. If no such closure was achieved, then a lasting reconciliation would be difficult. Singapore encourages Sri Lanka to work out a process which would seek to achieve such a closure. 
 
With regard to the second issue, Minister Shanmugam said that Singapore’s objective was to extend concrete assistance to the people of Jaffna. He recalled that during his previous visit to Jaffna in May 2012, what came through clearly was that the people wanted a better future for their children, and  they specifically asked for assistance in education and IT training. It is in this context that the various projects launched during Minister Shanmugam’s visit (viz. English language training, the mobile library and the youth resource centre) were identified and SIF was approached to spearhead the projects. Minister Shanmugam said that the programmes would have multiplier effects over the coming years, and if successful, could be built upon by Singapore and other countries.
 
Minister Shanmugam was also asked about the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) Resolution on Sri Lanka. He said that there were a number of different viewpoints with regard to that Resolution. For example, among the three major countries with close links to Sri Lanka, the US had strongly sponsored the Resolution, India had abstained, while China had voted against it. Singapore was not a member of the UNHRC and did not vote on the Resolution.
 
Minister Shanmugam reiterated that it was important for Sri Lanka to find a process to arrive at a just and equitable closure to the events of the civil war which was acceptable to all the different communities.
 
Minister Shanmugam also reiterated that Singapore’s focus was to help the people of Sri Lanka, within our means and in our areas of expertise. It was in this context that the various projects were launched in Jaffna to help the children of Jaffna make a better future for themselves. Singapore will explore how it can do more in this regard.
 
The Minister also highlighted the additional ways in which Singapore was assisting Sri Lanka. For instance, some 2,000 civil servants from all over Sri Lanka have been trained under the Singapore Cooperation Programme in a broad range of fields from urban planning through to water management. SIF was also engaged in a programme to enhance healthcare education in Colombo.

This will enhance the safety at home and they only need to pay 5% of the costs – the Government will pay for the rest.
 
Mr Chan is a very impressive person. He wants to be independent, told us that he was financially stable and preferred non-financial assistance. He hoped for elderly-care facilities where Mrs Chan could receive some form of physiotherapy. I assured him that we will refer him to one.

Our position on this issue is well known to Malaysia. We have stated this publicly, and also conveyed it to the Malaysian Government, including at the highest levels.  

Singapore’s position is that Malaysia has lost its right to review the water price.  The 1962 Water Agreement provided for the review after 25 years, and there was a right to review the price of water jointly in 1987. 

Malaysia chose not to review the price. Malaysian leaders have acknowledged that Malaysia benefits from the current arrangement, and explained that indeed that was why Malaysia made a carefully considered decision not to review the water price in 1987. It had good reasons for this.     

Malaysia benefits greatly from the current pricing arrangement.  Johor buys 16 million gallons per day of treated water back from us at 50 sen per 1000 gallons.  50 sen per 1000 gallons is only a fraction of the true cost to Singapore of treating the water, which includes building and maintaining the entire infrastructure of the water purification plants. 

Neither Malaysia nor Singapore can unilaterally change the price of raw water sold to Singapore, nor unilaterally change any of the terms of the 1962 Water Agreement.  

The 1962 Water Agreement was guaranteed by both Governments in the Separation Agreement in 1965, which was registered at the UN.  

Both countries have to honour the Water Agreement and the guarantee in the Separation Agreement.  Any breach of the Water Agreement would also be a breach of the Separation Agreement and of international law.",36,70,691,0,0,0,0,0

I spoke about the developments in Ukraine, as well as the situation vis-à-vis Indonesia, relating to Haze. 

I made the following points, and video clips on these points are available online:

Ukraine [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYS9qRhd1y4&feature=youtu.be]

• What is happening in the Ukraine impacts on all of us at several levels: 

• Potential impact on the World Economy and our economy.

• Other countries will see what patterns of behaviour are possible.  This is a situation of a standoff now between a big country and a small country.

• Several lessons for Singapore in real politics and international law.

• Have to assess Russian interests in Crimea: 

• Russia has always considered its interests in Crimea to be vital;

• Russian actions against the Ottoman Empire, in pursuance of those interests, led to the Crimean War over 150 years ago.  Russia lost that war.

• If one had stepped back and considered the matter, as Ukraine was going through its protests in the last several weeks, it would have been fairly obvious that there was a significant risk of Russia moving to protect what it will consider to be its vital interest.

• We do not know what was or was not considered by the different parties. 

• And we do not know what the P3 and EU plan to do next.  

• What is obvious now is that it is, unfortunately, Ukraine and its people who have to face the consequences 

• Singapore’s stand: 

(i) We strongly object to any unprovoked invasion of a sovereign country under any pretext or excuse.

• Russian troops should not be in Ukraine in breach of international law.

(ii) The sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine must be respected. 

(iii) International law must be respected.  There can be no qualifications to this.

• Two key issues:

(i) First, Singapore has always emphasised, that big or small: 

• All countries must observe international law. 

• And we have consistently opposed invasions: 

- In East Timor, Cambodia – we have taken a clear stand, even when our views were contrary to those of far bigger powers, who were quite unhappy with us.

- Indonesia, Soviet Union were amongst those who were unhappy then.

• We take the same stand now.  

• There should not be any invasion of Ukraine. 

(ii) Second, the events in Ukraine hold four lessons for us:

• Russia had signed an agreement in 1994 with the US and the UK agreeing not to threaten or use force against the territorial integrity or political independence of Ukraine. 

• They also pledged never to use economic coercion to subjugate Ukraine to their own interest. 

• Ukraine’s sovereignty and independence was thus confirmed by a treaty. 

i. Lesson 1: when it comes to the crunch, treaties are only meaningful if you have the ability to enforce them. 

• If Ukraine cannot defend the treaty, and has no partners which will come to its aid - and I mean with deeds, and not just words, then the treaty by itself will not help Ukraine.

ii. Lesson 2: In international relations – Size matters.

• The disparity between big and small countries is a fact of life. 

• And a small country which cannot protect itself puts its sovereignty and its people at risk. Russia is vastly bigger than Ukraine, and its armed forces are much more powerful than  the Ukraine armed forces.

• Russia is a nuclear power. 

• Ukraine gave up its nuclear weapons as part of the 1994 treaty.

iii. Lesson 3: something we have repeated many times: the Security Council cannot always act decisively to protect small countries.

iv. Lesson 4: When squeezed between two big powers/blocs, a smaller country like Ukraine can become a pawn.  

Indonesia - Haze [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2dHnpJJWtw&feature=youtu.be]

• Progress on this front has not been rapid. 

• I will highlight three points:

(i) First, ASEAN countries agreed to the ASEAN Sub-Regional Haze Monitoring System (HMS), which will allow us to better pinpoint those responsible for the haze.

• But we have not yet been able to implement the HMS, because the other parties have yet to agree to do so. 

• The credibility of ASEAN is at stake. 

(ii) Second, there was a media report on 4 March that mentioned that the majority of an Indonesian Parliamentary Commission was, in principle, supportive of the ASEAN Agreement on Transboundary Haze Pollution. 

• That is welcome news as the other ASEAN countries have ratified the Agreement. 

• Thus, once Indonesia agrees, the treaty can come into force. 

(iii) Third, we have had reasonably successful cooperation on the ground with Jambi Province. 

• Through a Letter of Intent (LOI) between Singapore and Indonesia, we provide assistance in technical capacity building and workshops, setting up of air and weather monitoring stations, among others. 

• This MOU lapsed in 2009. 

• We have suggested to Indonesia that we renew the LOI. 

• Our respective officials have met several times. 

• Jambi Province is keen for the LOI to be signed and for cooperation to continue. 

• This could help on the ground by providing technical assistance and capacity building capabilities to equip local farmers with alternative land-clearing methods, sustainable farming and zero-burning practices. 

• We are waiting for final approval from the relevant authorities in Jakarta, before the cooperation can be resumed.",6,10,243,0,0,0,0,0

http://www.straitstimes.com/breaking-news/singapore/story/singapore-explains-stance-ship-naming-welcomes-jakartas-overture-20140

In summary, I made these points:

(1) What happened in March 1965 -

- Indonesia was under President Sukarno
- Two marines wore civilian clothing; targeted a civilian building; killed and injured civilians.
- Part of a campaign of terror.
- Attack was illegal under international law - nothing subjective about it. 
- The two marines were tried in Court, found guilty and hanged in 1968. 

(2) What the event meant at that time between Singapore and Indonesia - 

- By 1968, and before the two men were hung, President Sukarno had lost power.
- Confrontation was stopped, President Suharto was in power.
- A new relationship was being forged.
- Indonesia asked for Usman, Harun and others to be released.
- We released 45 - two of the 45 had been sentenced to death for a bomb which exploded. 
– These two were pardoned for three reasons–
(i) the bilateral relationship;
(ii) the change in government;
(iii) no one had died in that explosion.

- Significant that this bombing occurred in April 1965, a month after the attack on MacDonald House.
- Yet we set them free.

- Usman and Harun - we could not pardon.
- Hard to answer to victims' families and to Singaporeans if we had set them free.
- Defining moment for Singapore's foreign policy.
- If we had agreed to release them - would have set precedent for our relationships with bigger countries:
That we should do what a bigger country asks us to do, even when we have been hurt.
- Would be a different concept of sovereignty.
- Decided that is not good for us.
- The men were hanged.

- Not easy decision.
- British forces were withdrawing in two years - Almost non-existent defence capability.
- But we stood firm, our sovereign decision. Indonesians were very upset; Our embassy in Jakarta was sacked.

- Within a few years, some closure.
- Both countries put aside the events of Konfrontasi. Relationship improved, now excellent, mutually beneficial.

(3) What the naming of the ship now means to us -

- Indonesia’s sovereign right to name war ships as it chooses.
- But sovereign decisions can impact on other countries.
- Here, Indonesia’s sovereign right intersected with a part of our mutual history, and mutual decision to put that history behind us. 
- Has to be sensitivity on both sides - why we asked Indonesia to reconsider naming of the warship.
- Very different signal when naming a warship - this will sail globally, carrying that message to every country.
- Difficult to proceed as if nothing had happened - why the TNI chiefs and officers did not attend the Airshow.

(4) What next -

- Welcomed FM Marty Natalegawa's constructive comments.
- Important for us to know that the marines were not being honoured for killing Singaporeans.
- Important to both understand and acknowledge that the naming of the ship impacts on our sensitivities.",25,8,279,0,0,0,0,0

They had set up a booth at the event to raise awareness for their initiative “Project Furget Fur”. The project aims to educate retailers and shoppers in Singapore about the cruelties associated with fur farming. They hope to inspire people to say “ NO” to fur. More information about their project can be found on their Facebook site https://www.facebook.com/projectfurgetfur

The young RGS girls had also compiled eye-catching material - such as posters, FAQs that can be pasted behind  doors, as well as a “fur-free guide” to spread their message. The collaterals can be viewed and downloaded here. http://furgetfur.wix.com/furfreepackage

_________________________________________________
 
Affordable healthcare is one of the top concerns among Singaporeans. This was clear from Our Singapore Conversation. Thus PM announced last year, during NDR, that Singapore will move towards having universal health care insurance. This will give Singaporeans  greater peace of mind on health care costs – particularly important as  our population ages. With universal insurance coverage, premium  has to go up. The elderly are likely to have less savings, and will need help in paying the premiums. 

PM Lee announced yesterday that Government will help our Pioneers, the senior citizens to pay the premiums. The Pioneer Generation Package unveiled by PM seeks to take care of elderly for the rest of their lives.
 
DPM Tharman Shamugaratnam will provide more details on the benefits in his Budget Statement. But very briefly, the package provides for following benefits

-       Medishield – more subsidies so that the Pioneer Generation can enjoy enhanced benefits of Medishield Life with significantly lower premiums.

-       Outpatient treatment – extra subsidies at specialist clinics, polyclinics an GP clinics under the Community Health Assist Scheme (CHAS) on top of other subsidies which all citizens already enjoy

-       Medisave – annual top-ups to the Medisave accounts of the Pioneer Generation.
 
Attached is the media release on the Pioneer Generation Package

Those who have done well in life should always be looking out for others - especially the less well-off or needy. It is basic human decency. Instead Mr Casey showed contempt. Having money and a Porsche, does not automatically mean that one is superior. Character is important.

I am glad the community has come together
to condemn what he has said.

He has attempted to apologise to Singaporeans. But some feel that the manner of his apology showed a lack of sincerity. And I think there is some basis for thinking that.

At the same time, I hope that Singaporeans will not attack or flame his  family because of his actions. We, Singaporeans, can be bigger than that.",489,800,3915,0,0,0,0,0

A determined young girl, Megan Tan (10 years old), gave the key note address!!! I was very impressed with Megan’s speech.

Megan is a primary school student studying at Maha Bodhi School. She is already volunteering at ACRES – ACRES had to lower their volunteer age for her! She wrote her speech herself. I was told that Megan is a very shy girl. Thus it must have been difficult for her to stand in front of an international audience and give a speech. But she decided to make the speech because of her deep care and concern for animals .

She shared with us her journey, motivation and efforts in animal welfare advocacy which include designing and drawing creative covers for notebooks – she found sponsors for her notebooks, and will donate the proceeds to animal welfare causes! Her deep passion for animal welfare activism and determination to make a difference to the lives of animals, came through. I attach her speech (which was delivered with creative pictures at the conference). Well done, Megan!
 

_____________________________________________________

Megan's speech.


Good morning, Minister Shanmugam, Uncle Louis, and guests.
 
My name is Megan and I am 10 years old.  I am a student in Maha Bodhi Primary School.

I love drawing, watching videos, and my favourite game is Minecraft. My favourite hobby is reading, especially the Harry Potter series and the Heroes of Olympus series. And like most of my friends, I enjoy movies, especially The Hobbit. So you see, I am just an ordinary 10-year-old.
 
Another thing I really love are animals. They make our world a more fun, interesting, colourful and beautiful place. The world would be really boring without animals.
 
We can also learn a lot from animals. Many of the inventions in the world today are inspired by animals. For example, the streamlined shape of the Japanese bullet train, which enables the train to move very quickly and quietly, was actually inspired by the kingfisher’s beak. 
 
Living here in Singapore, it is easy to forget how much we depend on animals. Many people depend on animals for food. In many parts of the world, animals like horses, camels and donkeys are still used for transporting people and goods. Buffaloes still help farmers with their work in the fields. Closer to home, dogs, cats and hamsters keep us company and are friends to us.
 
Animals are also an important part of our ecosystem. For instance, we won’t have any fruits to eat if not for the honeybees and the bats that pollinate fruit trees. And although vultures look like filthy birds, they help eat carcasses and keep the environment clean.
 
Even though we depend so much on them, many animals are treated unfairly. When they get abused, they cannot defend themselves or tell us how they feel. So I think it is up to us to speak up for them.
 
I get very irritated when I see animals being treated badly. When I was 5, I watched a documentary about how people were cruel to animals. They kept animals in cages and killed them for their skin,    to make clothes, shoes and bags. Sometimes, these animals were even skinned alive! I felt really upset, so I drew this picture and stuck it outside the door of my house. I wanted people to know that cruelty did not make them more beautiful.
 
Recently, during a holiday in Australia, we visited a whale centre.    It was a museum where we could learn all about whales. Did you know that a newborn baby whale is already 5 metres long, and whales travel thousands of kilometres across the ocean every year?    I would love to see them in the wild one day!
 
From that visit, I also learnt that the Right Whale got its name because it used to be the ‘right ’ whale to hunt! Why was that so?    They moved slowly and since they had lots of blubber, they floated when they died, making it easy for whalers to collect their bodies.  Because of that, right whale numbers decreased rapidly. Now that they are a protected species, their numbers are increasing again.    But it was only because there were people who loved these animals, knew how important they were to the ecosystem, and educated others about it, that we managed to protect them.

I also found out that there are scientists who spend their lives studying these animals, to find out how to help them better.    This is one of the many examples of how we can make a difference.

I may only be 10 years old, but I have decided that I can make a difference too. Since I love drawing and painting, I want to use my artwork to help animals. With the help of my mom and dad, we got sponsorship from a generous company to create a series of animal-inspired notebooks. These eco-friendly notebooks are made with recycled paper.
 
I have drawn 4 different cover designs:
•   In this design, I wanted to show ‘man’s best friend’ and the very special bond we have with dogs.
•   This was inspired by a storybook I read, “The Island of Blue Dolphins”.    In the story, a girl became friends with a wild dog.
•   I watched a documentary about slow lorises. Many of them were taken from the wild, their teeth removed, and sold as pets.    It was wrong of those people to keep wild animals in their homes, and I was really annoyed by what I saw. So I created this painting to help send a message about these poor animals.
•  This is a border collie I met at a farm. Her name is Jess, and we had a great time playing together.
 
I hope my art can inspire people to be more considerate to our animal friends. All of the money raised from these notebooks will be donated to ACRES, so please help all the animals in need by buying a notebook.Thank you!
 
I would also like to say “Thank you!” to the following people for giving me an opportunity to make a difference:
•   Uncle Louis, Auntie Amy, and friends at ACRES, for the opportunity to speak up for the animals
•   The kind people at A’zone Corporation, for generously sponsoring the notebooks
•   My mom and dad, for their support and encouragement
 
Margaret Mead once said,  “Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world. Indeed, it is the only thing that ever has”. Just one right action at a time, we can make a big difference and solve even the biggest problems.    We can make the world a better place for everyone.

Thank you!",190,1271,2890,0,0,0,0,0

833,2014-01-13 22:16:28,"There have been concerns expressed in the media recently about the ease of access to licensed moneylenders in the heartlands. I agree with the concern about not making credit too accessible. At the same time if legal access to credit is completely cut off, then borrowers will seek  loans from unlicensed moneylenders or other illegal sources. That, in fact, already happens frequently, when people are unable to borrow from licensed moneylenders or banks.
 
The basic point is this : if people need money, then they will try and find a way to borrow from someone.
 
What the law can do is to try and protect vulnerable borrowers. For example, current protections include : interest rate caps for those with annual income below $30,000, borrowing caps for unsecured loans and a minimum age of 18 years and above for borrowers. Moneylenders are also required to explain the terms of the loan to the borrowers, including all fees, charges, and interest rates. They are not allowed to advertise in mass media, and are prohibited from promoting their business through unsolicited communications.
 
These measures are on top of several criteria moneylenders have to meet before their licences are granted. The criteria includes ensuring that they are of good character to manage the business and the placement of a security deposit to ensure the proper conduct of the business. Moneylenders found to have committed offences will also have their licences suspended, not renewed or revoked .
 
Ministry of Law has also imposed a moratorium on new licenses since 2012 – meaning no new licenses have been issued since then.
 
The Ministry is currently considering additional measures to strengthen the moneylenders’ regulatory regime and to also complement the Monetary Authority of Singapore’s 12 months’ income limit on unsecured borrowings from financial institutions.",27,18,288,0,0,0,0,0

Those who penned wishes hoped for many things positive - good health, happiness and luck. Two persons hoped for ""Bad luck"", although I'm not so sure why. There were also heartwarming posts, some which read ""I would like to make my mother proud of me"" and ""happy old people"". I also observed a deep sense of pride our residents have for Chong Pang. Bryan Tan shared ""I grew up in Chong Pang. Thus I have seen it grow over the years. I am having my A' Levels this year and I wish Chong Pang and I, a successful year ahead."" 
 
There were other practical suggestions -  more cycling paths, parks, sheltered link-ways, keeping our food market. We will look into this. I am not so sure I can help with some students who hope to score certain marks at their PSLE exams but my message to them is that so long as you stay focused and study diligently, do your best.
